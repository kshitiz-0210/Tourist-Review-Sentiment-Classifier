Name,A Detailed Review of the Place
OctOriental,"Great hub of hanging out, boating, eating and recreation. Bordered by a long and wide promenade that is great for a romantic stroll. But needs to be better lit and supported by good quality street side eateries to make it a better place.   "
Konganapally Laasya,It’s good and it was so long ago that I completely forgot my experience but you should go It’s good. 
ShubH GhosH,"Must be an imposing structure but really cant enjoy the view, Narrow gullies, restricted access , irritating peddlers on road. Best avoided"
Deepyayan Ghosh,Hussain Sagar Lake adds a good view but from a distance as few parts have a sewage smell which travels to distane. But if you are in Hyderabad then take a drive in the evening. You also the small boats ferrying tourist to the statue. 
Shalini N,"The temple is situated on a hilltop.  The view from the top is beautiful, especially in the evenings. However please be informed that you will have to walk a lot to reach the main deity. Walking includes climbing a steep hill, flight of steps etc. Hence, if you have difficulty in walking, don't take risk.. the road leading to the temple is narrow "
sadhwani,"This place has nice breeze given the size of the lake and the open area available, though the smell of the water of lake takes time to get used to. Overall a good place for evening strolls around the lake on park"
srinivas,"Very nice employees.. Nobody is bad.. Very much hospitality.. I feel they are trained well.. Specially one Lady HELEN SHOWN HER helping nature.. What a patience she showed is fantastic..

Umesh R,Historical place One of most attractive place in hyderabad. Not well maintained outside monument to much of rush. Good for trekking.
Suresh T,"A beautiful temple made of white marble. This is the temple of Lord Venkteswar. Well managed temple and situated at height. A must visit site for Hindus, visiting Hyderabad."
Chandra J,"Incredibly busy, hard to walk. Good chai tea bakery right near monument. Went during Diwali so it might have been busier than usual. Couldn't get up close."
mohan,"The lake is nice and peaceful , but is heavily crowded in weekends. There are lot of good eateries around Nicolas road and eat street . Good to have some eateries seeing the lake. Boating is available from Lumbini Park to Buddha Statue"
Rajujacob,Its the place where I enjoed a lot during my trip. Because its a a huge collection of various animals n birds which belongs to different categories. The visit of all this made my trip happieer

Raman G,"We visited the fort as part of our holiday to Hyderabad.  It is part of your sightseeing itinerary.  Managed by Archaeology Survey of India. We did not take a guide. ( as compared, for Agra fort you surely need a guide). It is mainly a walk in the grounds and a abt 300 step walk to the highest point in the fort open for tourists. As Senior Citizens,  we did  walk to the top. It is tiring. Did it at a slow pace. The main attraction is the view from the top."
Aiswarya ammu,Its very Wonderful place in Hyderabad ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ especially the film shots palaces i really enjoyed ❤️
Aryan2007,Hussain Sagar is a necklace shaped lake in the heart of Hyderabad city built by Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah. I has been named after Hussain Shah Wali. It is quite a big lake spread over 5 to 6 square kms. It gets water from the river Musi. A large monolithic white statue of Gautama Buddha which was erected in 1992 stands on a  Gibraltar Rock in the centre of the lake. This lake also separates Hyderabad from its twin city of Secunderabad. The waters are not very deep though.The promenade along the lake is a nice place to take a walk is also known as Tank Bund. We did boating at the lake. The entry for the same is from Lumbini Park. The huge Buddha statue in the middle of the lake looks especially beautiful in the night with colorful illumination.
Atul S,The lake is big and the the ride to the big statue is interesting. Boating is available at very reasonable  cost and it is worth spending 1 hr. You can take few selfies there. The other amenities are just ok and could have been maintained in a better way.
Kishore W,Its but on a grand  scale but ppl dobt maintain cleanliness at all  they litter everywhere...and hardly use garbage cans...the toy train was fun..but wish ppl start realizing the importance of cleanliness
Dolly,Good yo visit near Birla Mandir Temple of Balaji build up with White marble really very good Maintain still look's fresh feel just construct done appreciate to temple staff & Management
Mukta2016,The NT Ramarao garden in Hyderabad is a nice garden located along one section of the bank of Hussain Sagar Lake and gives a nice view of the lake. The garden has many visitors cumming in the evening for a pleasant time.
Shashikant Pandey,Awesome place with full peace of mind. You forgot rest issues of life during you are there in temple. Its a heritage and beautiful architecture.
Mukta2016,The NT Ramarao garden in Hyderabad is a nice garden located along one section of the bank of Hussain Sagar Lake and gives a nice view of the lake. The garden has many visitors cumming in the evening for a pleasant time.
abrahamsuji,Easy access from city. Enjoyed the visit. Well maintained premises. Can opt for hop on hop off buggy ride to reduce walking. Kids will love the experience
Mainak_Choudhuri,"The mandir is atop a hill beside Hussain Sagar. You need to keep your camera / mobile in the cloak room and take off your footwear before entering the temple. The temple has clear side view from the Hussain Sagar side only (from Necklance road) but not from the entry side. It is temple of Lord Vishnu, made in white marble, with other deities like Ganesha, Hanuman, Sai baba in separate smaller temples. Thee is lift facility for elderly people. Very well managed, excellent visit. Good to visit in the evening."
casandeep,If you are visiting Hyderabad this place you must visit. Though you will have to walk a lot but its worth to do so.  Taking a guide along is must if you really want to understand the rich history and the beautiful architecture. How things were visualized 500 years back is simply unbelievable.

Kushal K,"Such a lovely feel to walk through the rich heritage that this lovely city is known for. It is such a hustle-bustle during the day but still is one of the most peaceful place, mix with our rich culture!!"
Soni,NYC place to visit to Charminar and local market around for glass bangels food (Britani) at Shadab and pearls market with some old pearls dealer ( Zacarias) 1 Sri Krishna pearls 2 mangatrai3
NAZEER SHAIK,Its an very devotional and visiting lace in greater Hyderabad. A powerful god who trust all the religions.
pvrkaushik,Its good place to take kids especially... Lion's den is the best. And hippo my favourite.. Little far from city centre... Take plenty water... Keep urself hydrated
KRISHAN S,"The place is affascinating , because of  its height and carvings present on the marvelous Budha statue. The boat ride to achive this place could be pleasant and more comfortable if the Hussan Sagar lake would have been maintained properly."
ullacarinquiterio,The fort was a nice experience but the biggest disappointment was that there is no  sound and light show as it is under repairs and no-one can tell when it will start again. 
Primal Survivor,Why do we have to pollute every single water body we get access to ?The concept of lake is good .Drive along is nice too but of lately the area has become smelly and water dirty.Food joints obstruct the view.
MANOJ KANDEYANG,"Memorable trip with lot of happening,buses are available round the clock... Free rides for children and adults are also there..will suggest to travel alongwith family friends,it's tiring to cover all points but are worth to visit..,birds section and small water fall are scenic ,adventure sports were great..zipline,uppernet,ATV..be hydrated ..every point has snack kiosks..Filmi Duniya ride was entertaining "
Sumit S,If you have a free weekend you must definitely visit this place. Specially for the teens. You have lots to do and can easily spend a day
Global-Bhatakanti,"Suggested time: Min 2 hours to max 5 hours.You can buy some basic snack and food items inside zoo. There are battery vehicles with ₹100 per person charge, but not of much use as you have to get down at every halt whether or not you want to. Also on weekends there is long queue for ticket and battery vehicle."
Sriramramanathan,"This is on the shores of Hussain Sagar, but the approach road is very narrow. This will lead to traffic chokes. Either go @ 7 am or if you go later, alight and walk to avoid delays. All vehicles ( specially cars) cannot turnabout until the temple gate and hence you will always have a backed up traffic to challenge. once you get into the temple , you have to deposit your mobile/ electronics and footwear into its respective lockers/ spaces. The mobile locker line will delay you further if you don’t go early morning. After this, the pristine beauty of the granite hill top temple will captivate you no bounds. The temple main deity is Venkateswara and you have the related gods and goddesses en route. The view from top, of the necklace road and Hussain Sagar is breathtaking."
007SureshHyd,"Don't miss the boat ride to buddha's statue. The skyline of Hyderabad above the picturesque Hussain Sagar lake has become more colourful with country’s biggest flag fluttering atop a sky-kissing pole at a record height of 88 meters.The national flag with a gigantic size of 108 in width by 72 feet in length was hoisted by the Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao on windy Thursday morning marking the second anniversary of the formation of Telangana State.The new tourist attraction in Sanjeevaiah Park on the bank of Hussain Sagar lake, which cost the state government Rs 1.8 crore, narrowly missed the feat of being the tallest flag in the country. The recorded will continue to belong to the 82 meters high flagpole of Raipur, the capital of Chattisgarh"
vinvara,"A peaceful heaven A sincere placecto visit White marble temple, very clean No mobile phones are allowed bur have secured locker service Good car parking spaceWas good to see lots of school children attending A must visit white in Hyderabad "
pvrkaushik,"Dense Green park in the heart of the city... Couple retreat... And great place for kids too... Fun rides, eatery etc... U can beat the heat with this place's greenery"
SRIKAKOLAPU,With lots of greenery this place can be visited in the morning or the evening and its nice and decently maintained
alpsbt27,if you are technical person and want to know something new then i must stay you need to visit this science center. its a really good place and techno lover place.
Gurus49,An evenly spaced out area divided by different areas and interests. too bad the Dinosaur section was not accessible by wheelchair. 
NITHIN KUMAR CHINTHAKINDI,"Golconda Fort, also known as Golkonda is a fortified citadel and an early capital city of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Because of the vicinity of diamond mines, especially Kollur Mine, Golconda flourished as a trade centre of large diamonds, known as the Golconda Diamonds."
Amit Bansal,"Challenge yourself to climb at the top. Great place to spend time.Prices for guide is too much, 750 & 1000 is too much"
Stay04043272996,We overcome our fears and had an out of the world experience. Enjoyed with my buddies and wants to experience these again and again.... thankvu wonderla
Dieneish A,"its is best temple in hydrabad , also photogrphy is not avaiable in temple .white marble ,nice view , on hilll you  can see lumbini park frm temple, you can see this temple from Golconda fort "
Milind Kshirsagar,Symbol of Hyderabad. Must visit. But don't expect too much. Not an architectural marvel. But surrounding bazar is awesome.
Srisadhana,Reaching the temple through narrow lanes by walk may feel tough but it does worth it. Such an awesome view of city we never get from anywhere.
Naveen,"Tank bund or Hussain Sagar lake it is called joins both the cities Hyderabad and Secunderabad it’s a great place to go with family,  evenings cool breeze chairs and lot of open place to sit and spend time with family kids can play,  lot of eateries ...there we have a Huge Buddha statue .. we have to go by small boats and one of the biggest Indian flag ... overall it’s a lovely place it’s a must visit if ur coming to Hyderabad ..."
shirin t,This another amazing place super beautiful white marble stares reach on top and the stone are carved tells the whole story of Vishnu avatars. All of them. And you feel very blessed to be there and don't want to come out at all. 
Vidyadheesh U,"Nehru Zoological Park is spread over 380 acres of land. It houses about 155 species of animals, birds and reptiles. It was opened to general public in the year 1963. It is one of the largest zoos in India and a major tourist attraction in Hyderabad.They sheer size of the park makes it a half day or a full day activity. There are battery operated vehicles inside the park for conveyance but most of the park has to be still covered on foot. It is better to be equipped with caps, hats or scarves to protect yourself from the harsh sun. It is a plastic free zone hence you need to make arrangement to carry water for children accompanying you, if any. What makes this Zoo more endearing is that the animals have kept in an open enclosure, however due care has been taken vis-à-vis the safety aspect for animals as well as visitors. The open enclosure is close to their natural habitat though not entirely replicated. The animals are stationed under the following zones:  Primate Park – Monkeys, Baboon, Chimpanzee etcCarnivore Plaza – Tiger, Hyena, Wild Dogs, Jackal, Fox, JaguarLion Junction – Lions, Leopard, Rhinoceros, Hippopotamus Bears Bay – Indian Sloth Bear, Malayan Sun Bear, various birdsDeer Land – Gaur, Antelope, Black Buck & NilgaiReptile Row – Various types of reptiles like snakes, tortoise, iguana, crocodile.Parrot World – Parrots, Parakeet, Macaw, Nocturnal Animal World – Owls, Porcupine, LorisElephant Odyssey – Elephant, PeafowlThe place is kept clean and hygienic. It must be taking a lot of effort on the part of the staff to maintain the levels of cleanliness.Entry fee is very nominal and they charge you separately for photography, videography etc.My daughter got her live introduction to wild animals here and now she just adores them."
Saurabh M,"Exploring Telangana...... Hyderabad.....at Zoo....Located at a distance of 16 km from Hyderabad, Nehru Zoological Park was opened to the public in the year of 1963. It is situated near the historically important Mir Alam Tank, which is 200 year old and is the first multi-arch masonry dam in the world. Nehru Zoological Park is one of the largest zoos of India . Run by the Forest department, Government of Telangana, the zoo has been named after Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of the country........What makes Hyderabad zoo an amiable place for both visitors and inhabitants are the open enclosures in which animals are kept. These open enclosures have been created to resemble the natural habitats. A wide variety of exotic animals have been successfully bred in this zoo park as well.There is electric car which is very helpful......"
Anne R,This is a very impressive fort! Very well maintained and very interesting to visit with a very old history. A must if you are in Hyderabad! 
challa prashanth reddy,nice and peaceful place on the top of hill and can experience the Hussein Sagar Lake. Temple Build totally with White Marble. No mobiles are allowed into the temple.One can find peace if we visit in evenings.
Aravind D,Nice temple and you definitely need to see this. If possible go in the evening where the lightings would be great.
Curious785091,"This really is a great place to get a good view of all the shops below - it goes on and on I'll tell you!  I don't know how they all manage to do it - but there is no shortage of stores.  All divided by categories (shoes, bangles, fabric, etc)"
Neelam Rawat,"If visiting Hyderabad then it's a must go place, suitable time is from October to December as weather in Hyderabad is hot after January,I would recommend early morning or after 4pm to visit charminar as at night it's very lovely weather.Please avoid your own vehicle as parking will be a challenge so prefer auto, aur cab for this place !!"
Sudipta Shaheen,The area near Charminar is so crowded that you will not able to move. Avoid going there in Weekends. Be careful with your mobile and money purse.
Mukta2016,The NT Ramarao garden in Hyderabad is a nice garden located along one section of the bank of Hussain Sagar Lake and gives a nice view of the lake. The garden has many visitors cumming in the evening for a pleasant time.
Getaway05685442397,We have visited wonderla with our college as the a trip from Bidar Gurunanak First Grade Degree College. We staff and all the students had alot of fun in wonderla . Thankyou Team Wonderla for the service and coordinating us for the rides .
Dr Manoj Swaminathan,"Kids will simply enjoy the various rides, which are indeed cost effective. Better to visit after 5PM."
Srisadhana,Lake is decent place to spend a good couple of hours. Nearby stalls are available to snack something.
NIL_MODI,Beautiful garden. Nice place. One should visit in the evening. nicely maintained. entry charge is there. small rides are also available at extra charge for kids.
TravelbuggIndia,"Ramoji Fiml City is the largest film city in the world and it is a good place to visit with family for a day of incursion. It has fun rides, film sets and the most popular Bahubali movie set."
Divya V,Highly overrated and outdated. Save your time and money by skipping this. They don't even have shaded walkways after these 20 years. No idea where these positive reviews are coming from.
Sunny Cuty,We both enjoyed by thr laser show and had a super excitement water ride.thr charges also very reasonable and kids can enjoy very much as we r yet to have them on our next visit 
Dr.Saravanan Chandran,"One of the must see at Hyderabad, you need a day to see most of the places, reach at 9am stay up to 7pm, maintained up to the international standard. "
Trail03702947730,All views are amazing and we have occurred issue with crazy car ride Crazy car ride instructor is not following mentioned rulesRule is minimum 6 members but he is arguing that untill 10 members come he wont start the ride and he stopped the ride within very few time that is 3mins 30sec
Mandar Jetly,Wide variety of animals - Safari took more time in queue - go for AC bus if you have money as there was no queue - Reach early - you can miss Aquarium - There should be more supervision in area of Nocturnal animal & snake encounters as Peaple make crowd and push each other.Overall worth visit if you like animals.If you are strong and young do not take battery operated vehicle.
Chandra J,Easy trek up hillside unless you have problems navigating stairs.  Great views of the city and of the whole area.  Helpful with a guide so you know what you're looking at
fudxplorer,A fantastic structure. Ab it crowded as we went on a weekend. Also we climbed up to the top of it. Steps are steep and bit congested while climbing and getting down.
lovetravelonly,"Objects related to history, science, space and dinosaurs are found here. Idols made before 1000 years are also found here. The most unique part is the history section. Historical lovers will love it to visit."
Andrew D,"There is not much to appreciate for tourists. It is a decent garden with an amusement park, but nothing else really."
SuvodipMoitra,"3 years back I went here for boating and it was maintained well. Today went there to see Ganesh immersion, the lake looked virtually green with water weeds/plants. No boating. No maintenance."
Anne R,This is a very impressive fort! Very well maintained and very interesting to visit with a very old history. A must if you are in Hyderabad! 
Vikram,I had taken my relatives visiting the city to show them the sights around the twin cities. We were unable to stand the stench and the place is very poorly maintained. It also due to poor civic sense of people littering the place. Sad to see the way people don't hesitate to spoil the enviornment.
GoPlaces39638235890,Wonderla is good...in this rainy day also we enjoyed alot we came with a college group...our students also enjoyed alot
Stephen P,The laser light show is really cool. It's the best one that I've every seen. It's worth going to the Lumbini park in Hussain Sagar Lake just for the show. It's at 7:15pm.
guddu1954,People have been visiting Birla temple but they are just not aware that there is a museum just close to the temple.It has a wide collection of Nizam era and provides a lot of information about Nizam .
ChhayaHyd,"Went there with my 5 yr old son, I was as excited as him. Big place, though needs some maintanence. There are no fans/ac inside so feels quite stuffy - pls the light is also less.  Local junta comes a lot because ticket pricess are low. Dinasorium is a waste. ..they should have some working moveing models. "
Mittal28,"I am having 1 year old daughter..she got very happy in zoo..different types of birds,reptile,animals,water reptiles,etc are very much..zoo is very big..take battery operated car and rome inside"
doug m,"Fascinating old fort with extensive fortifications. Allow plenty of time for the long and very hot climb to the top where extensive views are to be had, including the nearby tombs (which are also worth a visit)."
Fff,"It is a very good place to for the enjoyment and good time to spend with the family and friends and specially the surrounding areas like lumni park ,NTR garden Necklace road and IMAX theatre "
jastmeet,Wanna see nature closely then visit this zoo....most of the animal species can be seen there with beautiful look around...maintenance is also nice
SRIKAKOLAPU,With lots of greenery this place can be visited in the morning or the evening and its nice and decently maintained
Raj,"Waste of time.Not organised at all.Simply waste of time is queue.They asked all people to go to movie magic first and then  Doll store.. And so on. But instead they could have split the teams so we can avoid  waiting time.And also iits not worth waiting in queue and watching some dances. They are olden days strategy. But they are still following it.And not all the games are free, You have to pay for many games. And also 3D movie they charged 100 per person. All the things are not included in my Ticket.Ticket -- ₹1250 + 250 Dinner + tax its ₹ 1770/-  per head.Food is heavy costly 1biryany  500+Water small bottle 25.₹All eatables costly for common manNot worth at all"
1CCAdams,"Husain Sagar Lake was visible from our hotel and we have traveled by rickshaw around the lake in the evening. It is a must do on your trip. I was amazed at all the people, cars, motor scooters, rickshaws traveling on the streets with mere inches of separation between us all. A family of 5 has no trouble on a motorcycle with Dad driving and Mom side-saddle holding a baby. We laughed and cried as we watched all the happenings around us as we circled the lake and was brought back to our hotel. "
Sourabh Singh,If u want to exit early in case of emergency u can't...never visit with children below age of 5 years there will be risk in case of any emergency..event which happens in Eureka is fake..they randomly select person as a winner and force them to stay there till events completed...if u have your own vehicle visit then only because taxi and auto charge unnecessarily very huge amount
Manoj Kumar,"It is a wonderful place to visit. It was amazing, and the narrow passage were incredible. It was still under maintenance when I visited it. The charges for Indians were Rs. 20. There are many shops in the area, from antique shops to new. Shopping is all about bargaining. Street food is heaven. You will enjoy the views if you visit at night. "
Alok B,"Went here by boat, it was a really nice experience along with my family. The waves are really good to watch and place is clean."
Chandana Jain,"I have been residing in Hyderabad for the past 26 years and have been to Hussain sagar lake for more than 10 times. Hussain sagar lake is a lake that has a buddha statue which is apparently carved out of a single stone. The statue is beautiful and for seeing the statue you need to take a boat ride either from ""Eat Street"" or from ""Lumbini Park"" there are also private small ships namely bhagmati etc which can be used for a private party, kitty party etc which has a restaurant inside it. These boats also have a live dance performance. The regular boat ticket is priced at 50INR which is adequate. The statue is worth spending it.  The boat ride is amazing and it drops you at buddha statue and gives you 15 minutes to enjoy the beauty of the statue and click pictures. After 15 minutes it takes you back to either ""Eat street"" or ""Lumbini park"" where ever you took the boat from. The experience is worth it for 50 bucks."
Dinesh.A,Mission interstellar is superb good...we experience the reall space adventure awasome experience in wonderla
Puladasu Rajesh,"It's near to Tank band, Hussain Sagar in Telangana state...One of the famous Lord venkateswara temple in Hyderabad...."
stevebintley,"What a place! This is a must visit for anyone in the city and the colours and atmosphere in an evening are superb. I’m reliably informed that weekends are particularly busy, and given the number of people on the mid-week day I visited I’d encourage to avoid too, but it’s well worth battling the crowds to get into the centre of the action. There’s so many market sellers although none are too pushy, live performances and a generally friendly vibe. The history is great, so many good photo opportunities and a real insight into the local culture. Highly recommended!"
Vaishnavi_g,"You get to have a ferry ride, and look around the Hyderbad city lake view. You can go for it if you have enough time in your itinerary. "
TK,Overall experience was good. Food was great. The rides were good and adventurous.Enjoyed a lot with friends.
NG,Very sad state of garden - totally run down - absolutely avoidable - lovely trees n horticulture but on the whole sad.
sramanujamk,A must place to visit with children. Take a guide and learn both history and acoustic engineering mastered by our ancestors before the invention of electrical sound systems and communications! The whispering wall and alert arena are must-watch.
Sudipta Shaheen,Very nice lake. Well maintained. They charge 50 rs per head for boat ride. A budda statue us their in the middle of the lake. 
Rashmi_Warty,"Much better than what we had seen in a similar theme park in Australia. Perhaps the Indianisation helps. It seemed that the target population was (also) people who could not go outside India and the objective was to offer them a well crafted and entertaining content at a reasonable price, without burning a hole in their pockets.  Of course it does have high end packages for those who require a vip service. So it is a buffet of different packages. We had decided to spend time till lunch and then return back to pavilion. But we spent the whole day leaving the place only at 6 o’clock in the evening. In fact it is a place fit for spending at least two days. There is a lot to see especially for kids and the younger lot. It is a theme park as well as a working film studio. We were told that it was spread over two thousand acres.Action Theater - by far the best piece of the entire place in my opinion. They have cleverly woven audience participation in the show. Volunteers were selected at random from the audience and were asked to ride stationary two-wheelers to enact a scene of robbers chasing on the road. Then they showed the ‘reel life’ transformation of that which really looked like a live chase on a road. They also demonstrated how sound is added to a movie with mundane equipment. Highly entertaining. And gave us terrific insights into movie making.Bird Park was another place that we loved. The park has one of the best collection of birds. The birds looked in really good shape - unlike the usual bored ones in a zoo. The Star Wars 4D experience was also thrilling albeit short. Other star attractions are movie sets of Bhagavatham and Bahubali. The place also boasts a nice bonsai garden. There are several other things which one can visit depending upon one’s liking, age group, and energy level. If you think you require a leisurely pace, better spread the experience over two days. There are free hop on hop off buses all around. But still it is a not a place for a quick visit of a few hours. Or one can pay higher and go for the guided tour of one (full) day."
MD Murtaza,"Located at the centre of old city, crowded with families, friends, young,old ...is a place of peace and we get to experience a great culture that's different from rest of the city....must visit place in Hyderabad."

gabrial03330,"The place is indeed very much attractive. The temple made out of pure white marble. Really a must see place. Within walking distance they do have a science museum , planetarium and a archeological one with Dinosaurs fossil which you can have a real closer look.It's so mesmerising to imagine that we are standing closer to an animal's remnants that walked around the earth milion of years ago. "
Ravindra V,This temple is situated on the top in the area known as Adarsh Nagar. Made of marble and is simply marvellous. Photography is not allowed.
Alok Kumar,Ramoji Film City is a full day excursion .. u can be stunned if yiu see the film sets .. and will understand why all the streets and all railway platform look similar in films... They bring a clarity to your perception towards the stories of bollywood movies.. I mean u will fell amused .. the bird park is a treat to nature lovers

Mohan D,Very good place to see but we have to take from howker as it surrounded by them. Maintain properly but expect more to maintain properly neet and clen 
Avijit,"Sheer waste of time and money as I said in title. If managementbthoughtbthat they can mix fast food and  heavy lunch together, then this can happen. One can neither see the things they mightbfeel interesting although there is nothing much to see, except some old film sets, nor one can get time to enjoy the rides available for kids. The other entertainments are what ones get to see in circus , like action stunts, dance show, etc. In the digital era, these does not entice people. They should make it clear whether they want to promote it as game and rides park or mere tour of some so called fancy sets"
Wilayat,"Nehru Zoological Park is one of the largest zoos of India and one of the top sightseeing places to visit in Hyderabad. Run by the Forest department, Government of Telangana"

Anjana,A complete Shame…… the heritage site has become a cheap shopping lane . I was heartbroken to c the place. I had been here a few years ago n had fond memories but the current visit washed up all the memories….. wake up Government and plz save the place
Chandra J,Easy trek up hillside unless you have problems navigating stairs.  Great views of the city and of the whole area.  Helpful with a guide so you know what you're looking at
Umesh R,Charminar is a historical place. One of most attractive place in hyderabad. Surrounding place is occupied by shops. Famous for bangles and dresses.
S B Khare,"It has very low outdoor fun value these days. It is under very poor upkeep. I have passed by it but was advised not to venture near it because of foul smell. It looks great from a distance, but no boating or water sport takes place in these waters. At night, the city lights give a good effect and the statue in the middle of the lake looks great at night as well."
ullacarinquiterio,The fort was a nice experience but the biggest disappointment was that there is no  sound and light show as it is under repairs and no-one can tell when it will start again. 
Ravi C," Historical Building and very beautiful, place is but very crowded but when you will visit it , property not well maintained. "
lkoraj,"A very good place, very much decorated shooting points and beautiful gardens, good for children entertainment, nice shows like adventure, dance, film making process, space yatra, filmi duniya, action etc, big film sets are a very good attraction of this place, overall a good place to see."

rsraghavan6,"Very good place. It's a zoo you can enjoy. I mean all types of animals! Amazing place to visit. The location set for animals is also picturesque. I mean the lake is really good. If planning to go With your children, it's the place you should go for! Don't see the ticket rates. It may seem a little more at beginning but as you start watching the zoo, you will not care. Enjoy the fullest. And yes take your time. It would take time to watch it perfectly. Dedicate one whole day to it!"
TANISHK REDDY,Golconda is one of the iconic sites in Telengana state. I visited on a cool day and the views of Hyderabad hitech City was very good. It's a must visit place for all ages.

Milind Kshirsagar,Lumbini park or Hussain Sagar are the same things. Go to Lumbini park directly. All that is worthy of enjoying is there only.

valivali,"I visited film city on 01-04-2021. It was excellent. Best Place to visit in Hyderabad. Best for Families, Friends, Couples, Children's and for every one. Best in hospitality. Best Cooperative Employees. Best Guides. Comfortable, Clean & Neat every place including washrooms. Foot-by-Foot water facilities with cool and disposable glass also. Infact one day was not enough to enjoy the entire film city, minimum 02 days. Guidance and Hospitality towards us was very much appreciable. We ate Veg-Food and it was good, but price was Rs.300/- comparing to outside of film city it cost just or below 100/-. So Price was pretty much higher. Except food all are reasonable rates. Unfortunately i forgot my bag at clock room and left HYD and reached my home town. After contacted them they were very helpful and responded in a cooperative nature. After some phone calls and messages, i got my bag via courier and all things were as same as left bag(No things were missed nor disturbed yet).Finally i give 05 stars for film city and 1 star for Food Rate."
Mr. Himanshu Sinha,"Charminar is now getting too much filled with people, it's always very busy, and no proper management team is there. people are fighting over and over to reach a certain place, The stairs are very very steep if you want to climb to the top, the view is like, you are watching people everywhere. wherever your eyes turn you will see the crowd. Many staircases are closed due to maintenance, many rooms are closed, yes it's a famous spot in Hyderabad other than that I will not say it is a must-visit."
NG,Very sad state of garden - totally run down - absolutely avoidable - lovely trees n horticulture but on the whole sad.
Chetu1087,"It was good experience to visit such a big zoo after so long time. Area wise it was really a big zoo park but facilities can be improved like eateries, snack store etc. Cleanliness was good enough. "
jojo,"Of much historical importance the monument was crowded when we visited. It was properly maintained but the surrounding areas needed proper control.Being the lanmark of Hydrabad attractd visitors. Area near parking was not properly kept neat and clean.. The area was famous for shopping. especially clothing,, novelties, artificial jewelleries, domestic items etc. Bargaining was must. The people around were very cordial and friendly. Rather congested area more attenton was required.. The evironment of festival making happy especially the kids."
Global-Bhatakanti,"Historical moment inspired by do minar from Gowalkonda Fort. No parking nearby. One has to park car in chowmohalla palace. Street Market area around Charminar. Can be covered as day sightseeing tour along with Chowmahalla Palace, Salarjung Museum and shopping "
Bhupendra K,I visited here for a sunday run when it was raining. I enjoyed every step while running. You find a small patch of greenery and road as well around the lake. There is a small canteen opposite the lake and after run refreshments were available there as per my preference. Very far from my place.....but i can visit again for a solo run.

Wilayat,"Hussain Sagar is a heart-shaped lake in Hyderabad, It is spread across an area  is fed by the River Musi. A large monolithic statue of the Gautama Buddha, erected in 1992, stands on Gibraltar Rock in the middle of the lake. It also separates the city centre of Hyderabad from its neighborhood Secunderabad."
GoWrong,One great thing about Hyderabad is that it has got iconic public places where you can go  and relax with a group. HSL is one such place and I think very important which divides Hyderabad and Secunderabad. You can go for a boat ride and there are fun activities for kids too
Muneer,Hi nehru zoological park is a very beautiful park to meet a wildlife closely and know about nature I and my family enjoy this trip 👍🏻🐅🐆🦒🐘🦍🦃🐇🐊🦌
SRIKAKOLAPU,With lots of greenery this place can be visited in the morning or the evening and its nice and decently maintained

dr ganapathi bhat,"In Hyderabad, Charminar, Husain Sagar and Birla Mandir are must see.Hussain Sagar is a huge area. Lot of gardens adjoin the lake. The lake has nice boating facilities. Rush, during Covid, was less. May need half a day for seeing "
venkatakarthik,"great education for younger children to know our culture and lifestyle of our ancestors, highly recommend you take your child there"

Gurmeet,This is one of the best place to hang out with Friends or family  in Hyderabad. A famous place of attraction in the city
Sandeep K,You need at least 2 days at Ramoji Film City to explore it fully. 1 day is very short and can be hectic.
Meka S,"Excellent location. Beautiful temple made of marbles of Lorad Venkateswara on a hill top middle of the city. You can see the traditional Hyderabad oneside, secretariat and assembly the other end. Best place to enjoy Sunset and surise. The view of Hussain Sagar , necklace road and tank bund leaves you forever memory"
Sudipta Shaheen,"Its a very good place to njoy with your family and kids. Very well organised and well maintained place. Take the basic plan. Do not waste your money in AC  package. Do try to visit in winter months only. In hot seqson, it wont be possible to roam around. It willbe extremely hot.They do not allow food inside. You will get ample options for food and beverages."
TANISHK REDDY,Golconda is one of the iconic sites in Telengana state. I visited on a cool day and the views of Hyderabad hitech City was very good. It's a must visit place for all ages.
simran,Your hyderabad trip is not complete if you don't make a visit to this place. As i am from hyderabad and all those who visit us for a holiday we make sure to take them to this place. This time it was my 8th visit to RFC. Wonderful experience as always. As this place is huge it take the entire day. Make sure to take rest the next day of the visit as it drains you. 
LostMySelfTraveling,I love this park. It's a fantastic memorial of Shri Naandamuri Taraka Ramarao Ex. CM OF Andhrapradesh. It's a must vist place in Necklace Road. It's also close to Imax multiplex theatre. Children will enjoy the park alot. Very well developed and beautifully maintained park. 
OctOriental,"Straightaway you get a feel of history of an old fort. It looks good as well, spanning a great distance from left to right. But do beware, there are several spots where the guards warn you not to venture into as some stone structures have loosened up and could collapse. Some people disregard the warnings. Well...The fort has toilets. Climbing a few steps does afford good views. But you could go all the way up. Guides are there everywhere and could try to inveigle you by authoritatively directing you away from your chosen path as if it's not the way to go. It's easy to shake them off. Just ignore. But if you have a lot of time to spend there and are interested in history, apocryphal or not, maybe a guide could be helpful. But at the entrance there's a stone with brief history inscribed on it. Do read it to get some first hand history."
anil1967,A beautiful temple. Very serene and calming.The architecture is wonderful and worth visiting just for this alone.The Temple is beautiful and a must visit
Sai Harinath G,Absolutely worth itThe ticket price is cheap roughly about 75/-Can have whole tour in zoo Safari is 150-300 it is crowded and one negative the animals are locked in cage in safari also Animals were quite activeThere is toy train also with 10/- ticket every one should use it quite nice for such a big zoo  There are decent amount of food courts also and good food as wellIt is well connected with RTC buses

BRKanth,One can go for an evening walk but not much place to walk. Can spend an hour overall. Nice time during Ganesh nimarjan.
Kishore W,Its but on a grand  scale but ppl dobt maintain cleanliness at all  they litter everywhere...and hardly use garbage cans...the toy train was fun..but wish ppl start realizing the importance of cleanliness
Shashi Prakash Mishra,A beautiful piece of architecture built over a high place where from you can see a major part of city
Twinkle Sonar,amazing park..attractive atmosphere one must visit this place .well maintain cleanliness and amazing views
Vikram,"I've been to Durgam Cheruvu since late nineties when it was indeed a secret lake with lots of wildlife around. We could see birds, peacocks, snakes and sometime jackals. The path to a great extent was good for a two wheeler and one had to walk. For sometime the Government introduced boats. Concretization has killed the charm with most IT giants and their vehicular traffic & pollution has made it just a small water body.  There is a bridge being built over the lake which will further change the water body.  Visit the lake with an open mind to enjoy a water body in the city to unwind!"
Ganu,It’s good historical place in Hyderabad and it’s ah Good place for photo shoot and movie shoots and Marriage Videos It’s take one day to cover total fort nice place for family and friends
NG,Very sad state of garden - totally run down - absolutely avoidable - lovely trees n horticulture but on the whole sad.
chandrasekhar g,"Visited with my family members.Must have entry ticket.Entry ticket cost will differ for week days and weekends.Very huge crowd on weekends.After entering enjoy full greenery.For seeing Lion and tiger we have to reach through Safari, it will be provided inside zoo only and we have pay separate entry cost for that.First time saw lion very nearer and it was awesome."
Ashish S,This park was Excellent and was very well maintained. This park was very organized and neat. It was also not very busy.
NIL_MODI,"Superb Place. Must attend. Huge collections of animals birds, insect , reptiles etc...One should be ready to get tired if want to explore on feet. Big round enough to make you tired. keep drinking water and energy drink. Enough greenery to protect you from sunlight. They also provide electric car service on charge basis which will show the whole park. give enough intervals at fixed points to explore the life of animals. best option for who wants to round the park without getting tired."
beyondtravel,"Went on coincidence on lions day, we're awed by the variety of animals, birds, sections such as carnivores, elephant, aves, reptiles, herbivore including rhino, giraffe and hippo , butterfly, nocturnal, bisons, deers etc. But saw 1 lion only. Overall it's a great place and takes 4-5 hours to cover on weekends, located close to city. The park is well maintained with toy train, battery operated hop on cars, and ample animals to see especially if you have kids with you or if you are first timer. However inadequate signages make you  walk a lot, stand in slow and unorganized ques etc. The safari is a total time waste considering tigers are caged. Food options are too limited, better to carry own food. Do visit as a tick in box if you stay at Hyderabad"
Dipesh Joshi,Nice place to visit and spend time with friends and family. Entry ticket is 20 rupees and dancing fountain is also very good to see. Boating also available in this place. 
Ravi K,"The location of this lake is so good, with full of greenery. Its a decent place to spend an hour in the evening walking around"
Daniela R,"A veritable floating garbage dump. Smelly and dirty, surrounded by crumbled walk ways that did not even go all the way around. Add to it the horrendous pollution of the city which creates a haze that makes it difficult to see, and you have a truly bad experience. Not worth bothering to even cross the road to see this lake."
Climber59923544447,The view was amazing We took lot pictures ssWe enjoyed a lotThere are so many wonderful slides Thank you
Ravindra V,"It is one of the largest and top zoos in India. There are many exhibits inside the park. Some of the famous ones are reptiles, nocturnal animals, turtles etc. There is Lion Safari but it will be very crowded. Instead try the toy train. There is good variety of wild animals and birds. Plastic is not allowed but your own is allowed. Bring your food in steel containers so that you do not face any problem at the entrance. All those items which are not allowed can be kept in locker."

shweta_srii,"We've visited the temple umpteen times and it's always been a pleasant outing.The temple is at a height and one needs climb quite a few stairs but there is also lift facility available for the elderly and those who find it difficult to climb all the way.The temple is made if white marble and is super clean and well managed. Apart from the main deity of Lord venkateshwara, there is also a sai baba temple. Architecturally the temple is interesting as it has the southern style pyramid top as well as the orissa style top. It has intricate carvings in the main temple and also mythological scenes are depicted.The temple overlooks the necklace road and the Nagarjuna sagar and one can get a glimpse of the whole city from the top.Worth a visit in Hyderabad!"

Roving04785576285,"Hyderabad is a lively, vibrant city with great infrastructure, lot of greenery, lip smacking food and good roads. It's a little expensive though in terms of transport and cost of living, of course not expensive than Bengaluru but definitely a notch up than delhi and some other cities. not a lot of places to visit also, just Charminar, Hussain Sagar lake, Golconda fort and a few other popular ones. if you are looking for weekend getaways, you will have to either go towards Karnataka or Andhra or tamil nadu side. overall, you can spend a good two days in Hyderabad, roaming around and soaking the city, having delicious food!

Kaushik G,Hussain Sagar Lake is surely one of the popular attractions for tourists as well as locals in Hyderabad and we had visited the same during our holiday in Hyderabad. The lake is a huge one and we saw it while traveling through Necklace road and Tank Bund road. Boating is available on this Lake from Lumbini Park. We opted for a ride in mechanised boat priced at 55 rupees per person which took us till the Buddha statue in the middle of the lake. There are other types of boat rides like speed boats priced at 350 rupees per boat for 4 people and big cruise boat priced at 100 rupees per person. It was a great experience.
Mangala M,"Lovely lake... however the crowd for boating are not managed well. The life jackets must be dry cleaned frequently, as they stink. It's a punishment wearing them and enduring the stink!"
Soumyajit Saha,Nehru Zoological Garden is the Zoo of Hyderabad. It is very large and spanning in many acres. People must visit this place with family and children. There is a nominal charge per member. One can come to this place taking any public transport from the city.

Amir Sayeed,"It is better to remain away with dirty and stinky lake. The boating is reasonable but in stinky water. One can’t breathe the fresh air. Avoid it.  Better to drive, pick some ice cream, sit in a car and relax for sometime."
Michael M,"We were in Hyderabad for work but I was taken with colleagues to the Fort so I could see some of Hyderabad not just do work.The old (800+ years old) decorative carving showing the connection to what is now called Iran was incredible.There are several locations that have perfect acoustics - experiencing them is the only way to give it justice as words fail. For example there is a spot where if you clap you can hear an echo but walk two steps away from that spot and there is no echo. The age of the Fort is comparable to the early Norman kings of England - I had no idea that buildings like this existed in India that far back.There is a lot to see, and a lot to climb - depending on how adventurous you are you could climb to the top mosque.Alas there is a entry fee for Indians and a much higher fee for foreigners......"
Dr Manoj Swaminathan,"Kids will simply enjoy the various rides, which are indeed cost effective. Better to visit after 5PM."

Because of the vicinity of diamond mines, especially Kollur Mine, Golconda flourished as a trade centre of large diamonds, known as the Golconda Diamonds."
PrasadBgv,"The lake is dirty, but if you know the place well you can find calm and pleasant environment. If you are visiting during busy hours or in the evening you wont get to enjoy this place much. Visit early morning and go to the other side of the lake. If you enjoy walking, walk next to the lake beside the hill and go trek a bit to reach hill top - its an awesome view. "

Ipshita M,"Great place.FILM CITY: To call it expansive might be an insult since it's the world's largest, however it truly was ginormous. We loved the spots we saw and the carefully curated sets. The Japanese Gardens were a delight in particular and we loved the Bird Park. Had no idea they had such an amazing collection and the birds looked like they were vey well taken care of. The Moviemaking Part was amazing and the 'Director' was very funny.OUR GUIDE: Loved our guide Datta Ji. He was very patient and very courteous. He let us choose which spots we wished to disembark for and offered to take our pictures everywhere we went. He was very funny, jovial and amiable person.FOOD: The buffet at Sitara was sufficient so was the taste.OVERALL, it's truly a must visit spot if you come to Hyderabad"

Neelam Rawat,"If you are visiting to Hyderabad then it's a must go place, the best time is October to December and before 10am and after 5pm is the best time to visit as white marbles will be a bit heated so these two timing is best to visit there.You can't take your mobile and camera inside so there is free clock room to submit your stuff."
dr ganapathi bhat,"The name is do big that no visitor to Hyderabad can miss this iconic structure.  That said, the monument may not have a repeat value. The place is very crowded and unkept. Reaching the place is a herculean task with all that traffic, and parking is a big headache.However once in, the charm of the minar works well.  The structure is an architectural marvel. There are plenty of things to do inside that will make your day. "
Prachet,"Situated atop a small hill, the Birla Temple offers scenic views of the city.  Though I'm not into rituals or visiting a ton of religious places, the temple offered a moment of quiet after a busy day of sight-seeing in a hot and sultry city. "
Amit Rathour,"One must visit if in hyderabad,  beautiful temple and has an extremely scenic view from the top.best time to visit is early morning "
Ramyalakshmi G,The day was good. We enjoyed a lot. But the price may be according to weight category. Other than that the service was very good.
HARISH,nice and big garden...you can visit full garden via a small train in ntr garden with a nominal fee..
Prasun_Patel,Durgam Cheruvu Lake is also know as secret lake.. nothing much fascinating about this place ... good time to visit is the raining season as the water is available and looks good ... Summers its all dried up.... Boating is a feature ... but the condition of the boats are average not great ..... the view is good with mountains surrounded gives a nice feeling ...
JeffCarter,"This place is very beautiful - but things to know. No Camera of any type. Must take shoes off (not too dirty to walk in socks). You only need about 30-45 minutes. I am glad I went, the views of town are incredible and the white marble structure is stunning. I wish I could have taken at least my phone camera. This was not on a suggest list of places to visit - so I had to ask to add it. I am glad I did. But I did not try to use the bathrooms or shop in the gift shop so have no opinions of those experiences."
Sana B,I luv this place very mch as you can find so many kind of animals and birds there. It is good if you go with friends and it is having food and drinks too. The white tiger is quiet famous there and as well ypu can take a cycle on rent to explore and as well there is an open car which will take you to tour the zoo for those who dont wanna walk along with that there is a train in the zoo which give you the close look with the animals and its pocket friendly too.
Vaishnavi_g,"Very beautiful temple on a hillock. Avoid going around noon time, as the marble gets really hot under the sun. Worth a visit if you have good enough time in your itinerary. "
Quest797144,"The temple construction is in sync with sanctity of the religious place. Though it has many steps to climb, there is provisions for senior and handicapped people. Once inside the temple, one feels calm and serene in front of the deity. A great place to visit again and again."
muthukrish2000,"This is located near to Birla Mandir.Nice place with more science, art, Dinosarium. You can see big dinosaur Skelton in 3rd Level. Including basement there are 4 levels. You can visit this place when visiting Birla Timing. But only till 5pm."
Ankit G,"Great walk, nice trail, great views, not very crowded in the later part. Well maintained. Always improving"
jainms,Its in the center of Hyderabad city and very beautiful place & must to visit. Can cover lot of places around Hussain sager lake. Water maintenance to be improved.
lkoraj,"Very nice place, full entertainment of family, clean and beautiful garden. Many attractions for kids. A good place to see."
MukeshDave,One must visit this in the evening to have a beautiful view of the city and lake. The watchman was good to take us thru lift as we were with our old parents. 
Global-Bhatakanti,Science museum suitable for age group 6 and above. Personal experience is children below 6 doesn't understood much of what's showcased. Min suggested time to spend and require to see most things is 1 hr. Ticket price is INR 150 for all above 3 yr old. They should lower the children fee. Parking available in the premises but difficult to find on weekends and public holidays. On display is 160 milion dinosaur skeleton found in Telengana. Outside public premises has many antique idols and statues. Planetarium is right besides science museum. 
sow,One of the historical place built in 1951. .The view from top is awesome.the place is famous for shopping
PurnimaJaay,This temple is really beautiful and has a nice night view of the city. Simple marble build temple with good positive vibes.

Dipak Ranjan S,nice view of the city from the top. Lift available for old people.  REALY GREATfeeling when you will watch the puja.
VYR306,It one of the nice place to know about our history and their living style. It is located near Birla Mandir. 
beyondtravel,"The city of pearl is crowned with necklace road that surrounds the large Hussain sagar lake,  which is quite a sight on monsoon evening of full moon. "
DayTrip52942971023,It was amazing & super excited. I like it very much enjoyed a lot with friends And birthday surprise was amazing
Kishore W,Its but on a grand  scale but ppl dobt maintain cleanliness at all  they litter everywhere...and hardly use garbage cans...the toy train was fun..but wish ppl start realizing the importance of cleanliness
Traveler09576644006,It was good . Hope wonderla gets more rides soon. Have a great experience. We would suggest everyone to come and have fun
Rohit g,the lake is ok not wow.The boat ride is also fine but nothing very excited.Though we enjoyed the evenong
Mainak_Choudhuri,"This was my second time visit to the zoo to show my kid. Found that the safaris as well as the Reptile House and Nocturnal Animal house are closed. Got disappointed a bit.They have a cheetah exhibit, a large deer and emu exhibit, and a large elephant exhibit. Other animals worth note are lion, tiger, white tiger, wolf, fox, jackal, gaur, hippo, rhino, ostrich, two types of bear, giraffe, sambar, blackbuck, white deer and crocodiles. There are some walk in aviaries, but entry now restricted due to Covid situation. Did not see any large apes, but seen a few small monkeys. All animals are kept in natural settings, though sometimes a little small.There are battery cars which are hop-on hop-off types, excellent to traverse the zoo, though still it takes much walking. The toy train starts only after a minimum number of passengers. It is possible to walk the entire length, there is a major circular path and small inner walkways.There is a refundable Rs. 10 per bottle  deposit to take plastic bottles inside."
ullacarinquiterio,The fort was a nice experience but the biggest disappointment was that there is no  sound and light show as it is under repairs and no-one can tell when it will start again. 
Reon Sylvester,"It is a huge zoo spread over hundreds of acres. It has variety of colourful birds, Reptiles and other animals. White tiger is the most attractive one. And also few bears.One can rent a bicycle(individual) or electric vehicle( for a group of people) to cover the entire zoo by paying prescribed Fee. There are many shops as well. Overall, this zoo is amazing ❤️"
Dr Manoj Swaminathan,"Kids will simply enjoy the various rides, which are indeed cost effective. Better to visit after 5PM."

Safari44800858320,"I spent a precious time in wonderla with my friends.we enjoyed every ride didn't miss single ride also ,especially mission Interstellar is awesome 7d ride , overall wonderla experience is nice and good service"
Mukta2016,The NT Ramarao garden in Hyderabad is a nice garden located along one section of the bank of Hussain Sagar Lake and gives a nice view of the lake. The garden has many visitors cumming in the evening for a pleasant time.
pushpa b,"It's beautifully built. You have to leave your bags, cell phones and other electronics in the cloak room. So I suggest if you have a taxi hired, leave it in there. The view from the top is nice. "
Md Mushtaq,This is a amazing place to enjoy 😊☺️It's a world of life ....we really experienced the Adventures world ....in water rides also we enjoyed in the rainy day
Tarun,A must visit place in Hyderabad. The architectural structures is extra ordinary. The detailing of white marble are awesome. This temple gives you a different experience. It's well maintained and it's very neat neat and clean. The security of very tight. One of the best tourist attractions in Hyderabad.
Sagar P,Very interesting and different experience. Spread over 2000 acre land it takes everything out of you to finish it in 1 day. Around 40km away from Namapally. The summer carnival evening shows were very nice.
pvrkaushik,"Dense Green park in the heart of the city... Couple retreat... And great place for kids too... Fun rides, eatery etc... U can beat the heat with this place's greenery"
ramchabi,With kids this is a great place to visit. Kids can do hands on experience. The icing is dinosaur skeleton. If u have kids go here for sure. 
Sherpa64409243519,We Enjoyed the trip well starting from day starting till end. We would like to visit Wonderla once again
OPM,Great experience to visit to shower praise for a great initiative by Ramoji. A great display of art and culture and contributions to Society.
Rahul2604,"Disappointed, Landmark of Hyderabad still not well maintained,expected something better,also the area surrounding is full of street vendors,not saying that everyone should be removed but at least make a 10-20 m buffer zone surrounding the Charminar,vendors are as close as they can from the monument,not an pleasant experience for tourists when they are here to explore Charminar. The area around the monument is just like any old city area in India eg Old Delhi/Chandani Chowk,congested,crowded but full of life,lively,many legendary restaurants to enjoy,also this area is famous for pearls and pearls jewelry. During Ramazan worth to visit in evening/night if you are a foodie. "
sramanujamk,A must place to visit with children. Take a guide and learn both history and acoustic engineering mastered by our ancestors before the invention of electrical sound systems and communications! The whispering wall and alert arena are must-watch.
Shafeeq T,"Ramoji Film City is the thematic holiday destination and The World’s Largest Film Studio Complex. A 1, 600-acre land gifts the spectacular experience of exploring the wonderful attractions of the world at one destination. It is an awesome place to visit with family & friends."
Amina,Charminar is one of the best popular tourist attractions in Hyderabad.. The charminar thought nothing much to do there .. The mousqe is very beautiful and peaceful place to seat and relax your mind but out side is very crowded with small vendors.. Best place to do shopping for ladies.. Remember if you want to buy something bargain or else you will loose your money.. Bangles and Pearls are very famous here.. Don't forget to try Hyderabad world famous Paradise Biryani and Irani chai.. 
Jayaraju,We have wonderful experience at wonderla. All were very exciting. We would like to revisit again.very nice experience
Birinchi S,"Must visit place in hyderabad... Feel awesome... Great experience..The shows are great..locations are nice.. The bahubali set, foreign location are nice.. "
Jamila N,This lake used to be called secret lake as people hardly visited this place and now as the concrete jungle is building up the beauty of this place is diminishing.
Relax14297068989,We had great fun.. enjoyed with friends.. Food was awesome… Water rides was fun..Enjoyed this fun trip..
Abhilash K,This was established by late sree Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao. There is a boat facility to reach the statue. But the bad smell came from the lake is very bad.
rockzzM77,"This museum is interesting place to visit with kids, family and friends.They have huge collection.Must visit."
Michael M,"We were in Hyderabad for work but I was taken with colleagues to the Fort so I could see some of Hyderabad not just do work.The old (800+ years old) decorative carving showing the connection to what is now called Iran was incredible.There are several locations that have perfect acoustics - experiencing them is the only way to give it justice as words fail. For example there is a spot where if you clap you can hear an echo but walk two steps away from that spot and there is no echo. The age of the Fort is comparable to the early Norman kings of England - I had no idea that buildings like this existed in India that far back.There is a lot to see, and a lot to climb - depending on how adventurous you are you could climb to the top mosque.Alas there is a entry fee for Indians and a much higher fee for foreigners......"
Trail36163318322,Amazing it was too good we enjoyed alot sir 😁 twin flick and Recoil was too good wave pool was amazing and rain disco was superb 
alpsbt27,NTR garden is one of the best places where to visit. who come here always say we will again visit it. it is a really really beautiful place I must say in my diary. and we will also visit here next year.
Pavithran,Enjoyed the day .. and also appreciate the effort from John on the process. Must try trip for friends & family

Maresa G,"This is a worthwhile 1.5 hr roadtrip from the city Centre if you're 1. A big Bollywood fan or 2. You're a child.I am a Bollywood fan but not a fanatic, and found this tour to be worthwhile and quite a pleasant way to spend an afternoon in Hyderbadh.I enjoyed the fact that there is a lot more to do than merely tour a film studio.  Mr Ramoji Rao clearly is an entrepreneur who knows how to bring in the crowds, and this can be a most enjoyable trip for a family with young kids, with the very attractive amusement park, Eureka and Fundustan;  the Ramoji Movie Magic section with its Filmmaking experience, Eyelusion Gallery, Black Light show, Stunt show; as well as a bird park and butterfly garden, and a Japanese and bonsai garden, being just a few of the numerous immaculate gardens dotted around the grounds.We visited now during the last week of the ""Longest Winter Fest"", which ran from 13 Dec and which will end on 26 Jan;  hence the visiting crowds reasonably large, but clearly thinning out at this time, hence thankfully not having to queue for tickets.The bus tours offered between 10am - 5pm are very well organized, allowing one to cover the grounds of the entire film city in pretty much 4 - 5 hours. I thought this was more than enough time, but was rather disappointed that the tour guides only spoke in Hindi, and there was no attempt at all to accommodate us foreigners. Should you want to experience this park fully, one can book a night at one of Ramoji's hotels and then have more than enough time to experience the various carnival shows and dance performances which take place after the park has closed.No doubt, there is a lot to see, do and experience at Ramoji's Wonderland for anyone;  whether you're a Bollywood fan, a local tourist, a child, or merely just a foreigner wanting to see how Ramoji the Magician transformed 1666 Ha of land into the World's Largest Film City! "
Santhosh K,"Nice experience for kids, alot many things to see. Strongly didn't felt much excited while safari, animals were less and most of the birds cages were empty."
Greg48,I first heard of the Charminar years ago by way of a cigarette brand which featured the structure on its packages.The iconic symbol of Hyderabad dates back to the 1500's and is an interesting structure with 4 Minarets and 4 arches. The area surrounding it is a busy street and jewelry market. You can find inexpensive bangles (bracelets) as well as very low priced 'pearls' which would make a cute item for young girls. There are also a number of Pearl Shops supposedly selling the gem that the city is famed for. Not being knowledgeable about jewelry I stayed with the costume jewelry and found the market to be enjoyable.
Kalilur R,"The park is situated amist the middle of populated town. Thought it is a very old zoo in Hyderabad, the developements are lacking. Animals are very far away and seeing them is seems difficult. In safari very little wild animals."
Dattatray Bhat,"I had visited ramoji, couple of years earlier. But now they have done some additions such as bahubali set, space yatra etc and also butterfly gardens, sahas adventure park, you will atlest 2 days to see the whole place and enjoy."
Sunil,"Not much great garden, it’s ok to visit with family and friends just for fun and one time visit is good"
DrQuresh M,We drove there hoping to explore the historical site . However we changed our minds as a little rain had rendered the area slushy. The approach area was very congested and filthy
Escape46115598986,Rides and rain dance games I enjoyed a lot roller coster which is called recoil and I food non veg thali was really good
Rajesh T,Good place to see in Hyderabad and very neat and clean. Good and co-operative staff. Arrangements are very good.
TravellingReddy,Should see this place on a cruise from Lumbini park and reach Buddha statue in the middle of the lake. Nice view of tank bund and necklace road is seen from here. Water is bad and advice not to focus much on the water quality. Rest is amazing
nagesh1955,"one of the biggest water storing area in hyderabad, its servers the water to lot of people in hyderabad"
Sagar P,Very interesting and different experience. Spread over 2000 acre land it takes everything out of you to finish it in 1 day. Around 40km away from Namapally. The summer carnival evening shows were very nice.
S R V,"NTR gardens near Hussain Sagar Lake is a garden where children go round to enjoy their outings on week days. For people like us aged above 60s it was a leisure place where we could see cactus gardens, beautiful lawns etc."
Abhishek M,"Good place to visit with family and small children. It has different boating from lumbini park to Buddha statue. Buddha statue is only reachable through boats. At buddha statue you will find fountains, and lot of crowd during evening. People usually go there for photos. You are allowed to take cellphone and take photos. Separate charges for taking cameras. No bags are allowed in lumbani park, you can submit your bags at clock rooms near ticket counters. There are many places to visit around the lake. All places can't be covered in a day."
Shivam,It was lovely to check out local delicacy from the area and the view of charminar is amazing for nice photoshoots. The local area has some great cuisines 
Sunil,The palce is nice and its well maintained by hyderbad government .the kids wil like this palce and can find different varieties of animals 
OctOriental,"Straightaway you get a feel of history of an old fort. It looks good as well, spanning a great distance from left to right. But do beware, there are several spots where the guards warn you not to venture into as some stone structures have loosened up and could collapse. Some people disregard the warnings. Well...The fort has toilets. Climbing a few steps does afford good views. But you could go all the way up. Guides are there everywhere and could try to inveigle you by authoritatively directing you away from your chosen path as if it's not the way to go. It's easy to shake them off. Just ignore. But if you have a lot of time to spend there and are interested in history, apocryphal or not, maybe a guide could be helpful. But at the entrance there's a stone with brief history inscribed on it. Do read it to get some first hand history."
Him6788,Good place to go in the city and very near to Hussain sagar . Very clean and good place to go with fammily
sree143in,Near Hussainsagar lake it is located. a very big garden with lot of big trees and different varities of plants.
Vijay Mitta,"Marble wonder ,Marble Marvel... must visit place for people visiting Hyderabad... Very centrally locatated..."
Sunil,The madir looks too beautiful and they have well constructed to attract tourist and its nice place to visit 
OctOriental,Shoes off. Mobile phones no no. The temple is not any grand architectural piece of tourist interest. It's just another temple for devouts obsessed with temples. If you're not in that category put it last on your list.
Scarlet Fernandes,"Spent a beautiful day at the Nehru Zoological Park in Hyderabad. At first sight I spotted very few animals and was disappointed. But the safari visit inside the park was fantastic. Young and old, all will enjoy it. The deer enclosures, the birds and the butterfly park is amazing     Need to have some more well fed animals in the park. I admire the staff for their love and caring nature towards these animals."

Dr I R Patil,"Nice place it's huge kindly opt for battery operated vehicle if you don't have much time it will close at 5.30 pm evening, most of animals goes inside the cave by 4.30 pm. By walk it takes around 3 hours with battery vehicle around 90 min. Best part is they have most of animals tiger, Lion, elephants, white tiger, hippopotamus, peacock, deer, fox, Hynes, ostrich, cheetah children's will enjoy."
Pawanpreet,"ramoji is like a dream. I had not experienced anything like this before in one go. As it is spread in a huge area you need to board a bus to reach the first point from where your MAGICAL JOURNEY BEGINS. From there it is that super  sweet red bus to take you along.It is so interesting and intriguing and beautiful that you dont want it to end. Honestly you cannot see all in a day. Though I visited this place 2 years ago I m still in love with it. When this covid menace is over I would certainly go there again to regenerate myrself.  Its just lovely. I can bet that like me you too will be amazed. Go and visit if you are in hyderabad.  If you don't see ramoji you will regret it for sure. But a little piece of caution. The story goes that it is haunted, which is still a mystery for me."
Excursion48655171900,Wonderla is superb it's an excellent experience basically I am came on birthday that to wonderla offer the birthday offer with free entry thank you wonderla and finally at the evening wonderla and team celebrates my birth it was an unexpected surprise for me thank you thank you so much wonderla for this beautiful memories and for service also

S R V,"NTR gardens near Hussain Sagar Lake is a garden where children go round to enjoy their outings on week days. For people like us aged above 60s it was a leisure place where we could see cactus gardens, beautiful lawns etc."
AjithBhaskaran,"Worth a visit if you are on a trip to Hyderabad - it is around 1 1/2 hours drive from City Centre. Gives an idea as to how films are made and sets are constructed. Need to either reach by around 9 am or better still stay there in one of the hotels inside RFC the previous evening as you need a full day to see everything. Even a full day is a bit rushed. Best to pick up tickets ('Studio Tour' is good enough) online, go to the centre point (Eureka), attend the opening ceremony at 9.45 am, proceed to Studio Tour/Eco Tour (must do), have lunch, then go for the shows. Don't miss the Wild West Stunt Show! Lights, Camera, Action is interesting too. Rest of the shows are average, especially for someone who has been to other studios/sets elsewhere. Pick up a brochure and plan your day ahead. Food within RFC is average or even below average."
OctOriental,"Touted as a hallmark of Hyderabad. But it's a risky, unenjoyable and terribly congested place with a million or so hawkers cluttering up the place and rendering it unworthy of your time and effort. The least the administration could have done is clear up the central area at least to afford a good view of the Charminar."
chandrasekhar g,"Visited with my family members.Must have entry ticket.Entry ticket cost will differ for week days and weekends.Very huge crowd on weekends.After entering enjoy full greenery.For seeing Lion and tiger we have to reach through Safari, it will be provided inside zoo only and we have pay separate entry cost for that.First time saw lion very nearer and it was awesome."

Umesh R,Historical place One of most attractive place in hyderabad. Not well maintained outside monument to much of rush. Good for trekking.
Road62049353623,"The entry fee and food inside  are too costly. For a four member family, if you just ignore this place, you could visit almost all other tourist attractions in Hyderabad with the same expenditure if you have visited this film city. This place is definitely not for budget tight family. Entry fee of 200 rs for adult and 100 rs for child  are just good enough."
