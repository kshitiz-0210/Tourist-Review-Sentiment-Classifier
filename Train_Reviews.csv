Prakash,4,Awesome experience with a friend who was in a hospital with cancer in his late twenties who had to be put in hospital with a
Prashanth,3,It was a good visit to the Zoo. My son loved and we could spot most of the animals. He had a great time. Now coming to the bad parts of the visit - We went on Sunday which is the most busy day for the park.So as expected it was very crowded. We wanted to rent a personal cart but after standing in the line for 1 hour I was told they dont have any available I have to do the sharing cart. But they gave a personal cart to the guy who did not even stand in the line as he had a connection with some hid ranked departments. The guys driving the carts had such an arrogant attitude that most of the people riding it could feel it and had lot of altercations with them.Other than that we had a great visit and could show so many animals to my son. 
Ashwin J,3,"Have been wanting to visit this place since the time i came to Hyderabad.... The place is easy to locate following Google maps...Reached around 12pm and it was extremely crowded... Parking was a big hassle and finally they asked to park in a spot...Went inside and saw a long queue for the shuttle... Decided to go for the toy train... Apparently the toy trains were booked until 4'30 by some school... So they were asking us to wait for 4hrs to board a toy train... Hopeless management of logistics...The shuttle was managed equally bad... People just jump the queue and get into the bus... No consideration given to parents with little kids or elderly people... Management needs to come up with a smarter way to handle the crowd... I have been to zoos inside and outside India... Never faced this problem.... Coming to animals and birds... No animals were active... Most of them were hiding inside their shelter... Many shelters had only 1 animal. I have always seen at least 2 animals in one shelter... But here, there was only 1 tiger, 1 jaguar, 1 giraffe etc... No companionship for the animals... Nothing was great that made the experience a wow experience... Normal zoo just hyped because of low entry fee... The safari again had waiting time of 3hrs.... The lack of planning by authorities was evident everywhere.... Two layers of cars and bikes were parked behind our car... Struggled for minimum 1hr to take the car.... Will not suggest this place... You can take the risk of visiting this place but don't drive and be ready to wait and wait and wait"
Amit Khare,2,It was too overcrowded even to have a look properly. We went in the evening time and there was not even space to stand. There was a problem of parking near the monument hence better to go by cab. The market is also too crowded to even take a look at goods properly.
ChennaiShaji,4,A land mark which you cannot miss while in the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. jut roam around or you can have a short boat ride.
Happiness63679548654,4,Good but food is high costly and average food good place to spend time in wonderla. Good place to visit
NIL_MODI,4,Beautiful garden. Nice place. One should visit in the evening. nicely maintained. entry charge is there. small rides are also available at extra charge for kids.
Deepak Warrier,5,"a very good place for the budding scientists...in fact, those who have a scientific bent of mind can have a good time at this place...if you want to enjoy the show at planetarium, reach the place early..say 45 minutes..... "
Abhishek807,5,One of the Best Timepass for Kids... Perfect for Them... Should take your kids for this wonderful journey
Gurutej,3,"Nothing very special here. To be visited only because it is the landmark of Hyderabad. 
The parking area is almost non-existent, and the place is fully congested. "
Kishore W,2,Its but on a grand  scale but ppl dobt maintain cleanliness at all  they litter everywhere...and hardly use garbage cans...the toy train was fun..but wish ppl start realizing the importance of cleanliness
Pratik Choudhari,4,Made out of white marble birla Mandir is located at a hill top and provides Hyderabad's skyline view. Temple premises is clean and tidy. Must visit in Hyderabad if not for god visit for the atmosphere there and the view.
shaggy2015,3,There is statue in mid of the river of late Hussain Sagar. This is also best place to visit. I don't whether boating is allowed in this river. 
Kashim,4,Super excellent some missed raiding activities water activities super excellent I have superb experience
ravishtandon,5,You can see open safari at Hyderabad Zoo. The zoo is spread in a very vast area and a good place to visit with family. Toy train and open elephants are another attraction.
Gurus49,5,An evenly spaced out area divided by different areas and interests. too bad the Dinosaur section was not accessible by wheelchair. 
Niranjan R,5,Wonderla is extremely awesome experience with my family and kids we spent a precious time and carry back with superb memories with us even we celebrated our lovable kids birthday in wonderla is special moment for us thank yuo wonderla and team for the kind service 
OctOriental,4,"The Nehru Zoological Park could be better organised. Outside the main gate it is a bit too chaotic and noisy and dusty with broken roads but that's Hyderabad. The zoo could have done with more logical signposts to different enclosures so that we don't miss a single creature. The safari rides last 15 minutes but give you a good look at lions, tigers, bisons. Lots of schoolkids on their school-organised visits lend to the nice feel of the place. Most commonly known wild animals are here. Must visit."
Kaushik G,4,"This is a beautiful garden created in the memory of the legendary film personality cum leader NTR and we had visited the same during our sightseeing in Hyderabad. This place is located on the banks of Hussain Sagar Lake. We paid 20 rupees per person entrance tickets. Inside there are many paid rides like toy train, swing etc. We walked around the paved walkway in the middle of well maintained manicured lawns, beautiful flowers and fountains. Good to visit this along with Lumbini Park and boating in Hussain Sagar Lake."
Jayavel D,5,Very beautiful place and construction was tremendous and shows the passionate of the person who constructed.
Manohar M,4,Great place especially the planetarium was an eye catching where one cannot resist wondering with time travel.The best place one should visit
Kashyap Kocherlakota,5,"I had been to this place long ago and I still remember the fun I had here. I had been for a social gathering and the place can be customized so well according to the requirement. It is a great place for all kinds of corporate parties, and get-togethers.  Adventure activities are also present and is a well maintained place.Boating is also available."
OMKAR PAGADALA,5,I have enjoyed a lot by visiting this zoo. It's is a very big area. And animals are taken care very nicely.
Sohail S,4,"If you have a phone with decent camera capabilities, that's more than enough to capture stunning pictures for your Instagram/WhatsApp dp uploads. You should visit the place after 6 pm, which is when the lighting starts.Have uploaded some pictures. Let me know how you find them.Thanks!"
Naren,4,Durham cheruvu is a beautiful place spend a stress free evening. It's located near Raheja mind space Madhapur. The current TS government concentrated to develop this lake as a beautiful picnic spot for hyderabadies.... Njoy beautiful evening.
Oneil,4,This is one of the places worth visiting when in Hyderabad. It has been maintained & kept fairly clean & enforced by their vigilant security staff. The only short-coming is the rates fixed by the guides there. INR 1250 charged by them is a little excessive.Electronic audio guides need to be installed by the Government/Management at the earliest.
Connector67318695625,4,Rides were very thrilling and worth the money.And Special mention to a mission interstellar worth having a ride thereüòÄüòÉüòç
Traveller,3,It is crowdy market. Any one really wants to enjoy some ancient article for eg night lamps .Giftboxes  Necklaces Bengals dryfruits shawls has to be definitely. Visit this Charminar.Nice building.
TheoP0001,5,"Especially on the weekends, the colours and tastes are breathtaking. But brace for enormous crowds. Yet, we never felt scared or concerned. But yes, there are thousands of merchants selling every cheap bangle, scarf and shoe you can imagine with dozens of fruit vendors and drugists.  All in the open space around the historic monument. But brace for the crowds. "
Arunkumar,3,I didn't find parking on the day of Christmas. it's very crowdy. A good place to visit to have a fresh air and surrounded by the animal planet.
Amit Khare,4,Do‚Äôs 1. Reach early.2. Take a bus tour at the earliest to first know the place and then prioritize the locations. 3. Prioritize as per own choice. 4. Carry water. Don‚Äôts 1. Waste time in initial photography as there are many places to click pics. 2. Don‚Äôt wait for kids rides till the end as the crowd increases towards later half. 
Appu M,3,It was actually great experience but tiresome ... Once u have entered its Mandatory to complete whole tour ... Food inside is very costly .. and they don't let you take your own food
Jaykann,5,Must to do while you are in Hyderabad. Plan one full day activity as so much things to see and activities to do. This place entertainers not only kids and teenagers but to all age groups. Well organized guided tour and memorable experience from the moment you step in until you leave the place. Whole property is very well maintained. Plenty of photo options for photography lovers.While we come across each sets it reminds of some movie of any Indian language. Highlight is Bahubaali set for our group. Lot of walking involved inside but great experience.Definitely with high standards and competitive comparison with other similar concept around the world. It was not really fully crowded probably because of school examinations time and week day as well. Great memorable experience. Descent food options available inside at decent price range. Definitely 5 stars and each penny worth spending.
NITASH,5,The view from this Temple is beautiful. Cameras aren't allowed here so you can't click pictures of the views. It's squeaky clean and we had a good visit here.
BhaskarVVB,5,"If you are a runner or a walker, this 10 Km worthy physical effort early in the morning. I was fortunate to run around this lake at least three times in the past few weeks. Highly recommended for fitness buffs, Beware of the pollution in certain pockets of this route."
Kishore W,2,Its but on a grand  scale but ppl dobt maintain cleanliness at all  they litter everywhere...and hardly use garbage cans...the toy train was fun..but wish ppl start realizing the importance of cleanliness
Greg48,4,"This was an fun way to spend a few hours. It is listed as the World's largest film studio, and indeed the tram tour dovers acres of land and a multitude of film sets. You can possible see ongoing filming and the attractions and occasional performers that you meet are entertaining.As an visiting American, I wasn't familiar with the films that had been made here, but nonetheless was impressed with the studio lots and the tram tour. Everything was professionally done and the staff was good about getting people back ontime after each stop. I note that the tour was not in English, but that didn't really affect my ability to enjoy and understand what we were seeing."
Daydream23952088583,5,We were group of 45 and we enjoyed a lot here. All the staff are too supportive. They helped us on priority for all entry process. 
SoloMTraveler,5,"The biggest Park in Hyderabad. Hundreds of animals, birds, species that you can have a look. Normally weekends are busy. Recommended on weekdays."
Nimmagadda D,5,hep   this the first science centre i  visited with great practical experience you can  get  from here trust me you can get a great experience vistit this place
Konganapally Laasya,4,Since I am an Indian Hindu my family has some traditions And since I am 10 years old i have to start wearing half sarees For that we need to throw a party as my first day wearing half sareeWe threw that party in Ramoji Film City hawa mahal and everything was great the food the atmosphere and everything we book hotel rooms in Tara hotel and we stayed for a night the next morning we did a photo shoot in Ramoji Film City The reason I gave four stars is because it was really expensive it nearly cost 3 lakhs and the next morning my rooms shower broke and the hair dryer was not working But still you should visit Ramoji Film City cause it‚Äôs the greatest experience I‚Äôve ever had 
AbhayKrSinha,4,"This is a wonderful place to stroll & enjoy the Hyderabad culture. You can also come here by train and the nearest station is Necklace Road. Beside the lake, there is all around parks, where you can have the quality time with your family & friends. Can have a boat ride till the middle of Buddha Statue. Speed boat costs 345 Rs. for 04 person & ferry will cost 55 Rs. per person. Can enjoy local foods along with the international food outlets. There are two places from where you can have the boating facility. One is very crowded but another is having less crowd which is closer to Necklace Road railway station."
Rajesh Ramamurthy,5,"The sheer enormity of this place means travelers are bound to be left wondering about the logistics of moving around. Believe me, as a family of four including two children, we found the logistics was handled seamlessly. The guides were well informed and the trip moved in a sequential manner. Facilities such as rest rooms, restaurants etc. were also positioned to the advantage of all guests. Highly recommended"
Tourist40373234933,4,Wonderland is nice we enjoyed with our friends nice place to visit we ride all the rides not only single time more than three times it's superb
jastmeet,5,My first ever visit to this so spiritual temple........temple located at such a height that entire city Glimpse appears therefrom.....

Mythri Sekhon,5,"Nice place and a great stress buster specially the evenings. Had a great time. All kinds of food and snacks are there and all are good to eat, the tea is amazing. Good place to play for small children. "
HARISH,4,nice and big garden...you can visit full garden via a small train in ntr garden with a nominal fee..
Bhavesh Bariya,1,Terrible experience...Started the journey early morning...7.30..very far isolated from main city. They don't allow any kind of food item... selling their food items in their stalls at very high rates....20 rupees item available at the rate of 80 rupees. Also all the items are fast food...so small children and elderly may suffer from hypoglycemia...no healthy choices available...It's only money making business... ticket rates are already very high...the difference between adult and children rate only 200rupees...not in capacity to visit the tour by middle class...who have earned the money by hard work...No resting place with shadow at some points...can not visit again...After visiting the place you are the most tired person...Food must be available at reasonable price or visitors should be allowed food items to carry...
Praveen K,,"Visit to this magnificent fort is incomplete without attending light & sound show in the evening, which tells the story of fort and the city"
S R V,4,"NTR gardens near Hussain Sagar Lake is a garden where children go round to enjoy their outings on week days. For people like us aged above 60s it was a leisure place where we could see cactus gardens, beautiful lawns etc."
fudxplorer,5,A must visit fort if you are in hyderabad. A vast structure and lot of climbing to do. A lot of places to take pics. Evenings are crowded
Paradise41756759514,5,I like rides and swimmingI like food and rain dance and wavesI fully Enjoyed the woder full wonderla
Global-Bhatakanti,3,Science museum suitable for age group 6 and above. Personal experience is children below 6 doesn't understood much of what's showcased. Min suggested time to spend and require to see most things is 1 hr. Ticket price is INR 150 for all above 3 yr old. They should lower the children fee. Parking available in the premises but difficult to find on weekends and public holidays. On display is 160 milion dinosaur skeleton found in Telengana. Outside public premises has many antique idols and statues. Planetarium is right besides science museum.

Indusman248,3,"Spent some 20 minutes and found that the Lake experience can be enhanced with a museum, dining destination and Buddha meditation halls. We took a speed boat but event the boats can be made available of better quality with Guides."
The Route Edit,4,"This was my second visit to the fort. Last time we visited we didn't have time for the light and sound show so this time I made it a point to stay back for it. The fort itself is very beautiful provided you like historical places or else it would seem brick and mortar debri. Take a registered guide and remember to bargain for the rate coz without a guide it might seem boring. The view from the top is worth the climb and do check the amazing architectural acoustics of the fort. Coming to the light and sound show, I would suggest you give it a miss. They give you a complimentary odomos tube with the tickets so you can imagine the amount of mosquitoes you are about to face during the show. You will be so busy battling mosquitoes that the real battle stories wouldn't seem that interesting. I sat there and dozed off for a major part of the show. I like history and have watched lots of light and sound shows but I guess this experience wasn't that great for me. "
Niki,4,It's good basically we are from West Bengal it is our first time visit wonderla it's superb experience with my friends it's really awesome experience
Alok Kumar,5,Golconda Fort is in the outskirts of city... the tourist guide are must who explains the stories of glory .. they will take yiy back hundreds of years back.. in history... Good for visiting in a cloudy day.. as it's hot in summer.. Specially if sun is scrotchy .. govwirh goggles and umbrella
Amit Anshu,5,"Great place to hangout with friends and family ,some much new things you will come across ,there is bahubali set also there is artificial foreign country, artificial village everything you will see there wht you see in movie..."
Muneer,3,It‚Äôs a very beautiful and relaxing place for all family I and my family spend a cool üòé time on this trip üëçüèª
shirin t,5,We went there another couple. It is unbelievable place no one can rate it less then 5. If in Hyderabad should go. It's a whole day visit place. Try going after August. Or may be winters. 
OctOriental,4,"Straightaway you get a feel of history of an old fort. It looks good as well, spanning a great distance from left to right. But do beware, there are several spots where the guards warn you not to venture into as some stone structures have loosened up and could collapse. Some people disregard the warnings. Well...The fort has toilets. Climbing a few steps does afford good views. But you could go all the way up. Guides are there everywhere and could try to inveigle you by authoritatively directing you away from your chosen path as if it's not the way to go. It's easy to shake them off. Just ignore. But if you have a lot of time to spend there and are interested in history, apocryphal or not, maybe a guide could be helpful. But at the entrance there's a stone with brief history inscribed on it. Do read it to get some first hand history."
ramchowdry,5,"Wonderful temple view and recommend to visit with family .Preferably in the evening be there by 6:30 to 7:00  , really amazing temple ."

Nazura Javed,3,"The place is in ruins , needs better maintenance  and amenities like toilets. The approach road is through crowded narrow roads. Reaching the top of the fort requires a bit of stamina for one has to climb up steps and it can be a little hard for those not used to it. Also the day we went the place was pretty crowded.The good thing is that one does get a feel of history (especially if one is somewhat aware of Deccan India history) and also a great view of the city once you reach the top of the fort."

P V NEELAKANTA R,5,it is a nice place to visit with family and friends on weekend .you can spend time at leisure here on weekends
Rakesh,4,"Dont Rush your day by planning half day zoo tour, I suggest anyone to allocate whole day here. if possible, one routine suggestion i would like to give here, Plan it on weekdays (except on closing day- Monday i guess), because when we went there on Sunday, its totally Crowd, and you may not like it, people bring mats and water cans then eat food on lawns.if you are a pack of 10 or so, then you can book a resting room or retiring room also, you can google for that info.Coming to imp part, never miss lions, tigers and lot of animals like giraffe, also white tigers.Most importantly follow the path guided by them, because you may end of moving in the zoo walking extra without watching all animals. Zoo is very very bigHave fun. Enjoy your trip"
avenkat2016,5,"even with limited resources, they have managed to put together a nice collection of experiments and phenomena for kids to understand and explore. great for kids under 13, who are into science. the degree of hands on interaction ensures kids learn and enjoy science more, rather than having fancy things behind glass cases."
Abhilash K,4,This is one of the big zoos in India. There are lot of species available here. You can visit here and enjoy with your kids.
Nikola Nesic,5,"Take off your shoes and enjoy the marble under your feet. Beatufiul place, with astonishing view from it."

EASWAR52,3,"Historical CHARMINAR is the centre of attraction in Hyderabad. It is located in the midst of buzzing bazars. It is a simple structure containing four minarets. There are there are stairs with narrow & steep steps. In the upper floor one can see archways leading to balconies overlooking all four sides. These balconies provide beautiful views. Local culture is visible from the structure. The structure loses its worth due to the poor maintenance. In view of the steepness of the steps older people & those with knee issues will have difficulty in climbing the stairs. Though it is treated as a mosque it doesn‚Äôt look like one. Congested location makes the visit all the more difficult. One can visit here only to cherish the history and the view from here.

krajeevc,5,"This zoo is one of the best in India.You have buggy services to drop/hop you to 5 points each of which covers a significant portion of zoo.There is a seperate lion safari bus ride and a train  ride.The rest rooms are not up to the mark and need to be upgraded. Food / Canteen facilities are good and reasonably priced. One needs to spend 4-5 hrs at least to cover the entire zoo.If you do not want to explore on foot and get overly tiered, use the buggy service or rental cycles. Keep hydrated throughout. This Zoo is worth visiting."

RiseRichard,1,I decided to visit Durgam cheruvu with my parents and family on Sunday. Entry fee of Rs 30 doesnot include boating. Its small park with no place for either walk or sitting and there is no lawn at all. To sum it up its waste of time.. The lake is dead.. The park is destroyed and vandalized. You will come across broken benches and litter every where. If the stench does not make you ill then the cool drinks or snacks will surely make you ill. Out side food is not allowed and you are forced to buy stale food. I would rate it negetive but as 1 is the least possible rating that I can give for this park.. so be it
Rohit Bandil,1,"I had gone on 1st jan 2020 with my family.It was huge rush there and there was no management to handle those many peoples. Unfortunately rain had come and people started breaking there queue and stated rushing into the temple. Temple does not have capacity & space to handle more crowd.Small children were crying in the rush and temple floor became very slippery due to water. There was no management, children were crying, entry side people were breaking queue.It was almostt stampedelike a situation in the temple but fortunately, by god grace, r an hia stoped after some time. I would not recommended & suggest to visit on any festival or an new year day like.Temple is very good and place is very calm. You can plan it on any other day.d"
Umesh R,5,Historical place One of most attractive place in hyderabad. Not well maintained outside monument to much of rush. Good for trekking.
Dr yogita chaudhuri,5,"Very well organised ,well executed,trip .Helpful and polite staff .As contrast to online reviews eateries were reasonable .Its too vast obviously one cannot target every thing in one go !!!its a paisa vasool trip"
Gurudath,1,"This once lush lake has sadly been turned to a swamp with buffaloes strolling in the knee deep waters, seeking respite from the heat. The authorities' apathy and absolute lack for preserving lakes and water bodies has spelt death to this place. There's nothing now worth going to this lake."
Devaa,4,Its a huge zoo almost in the the heart of the city. There is nothing extraordinary here common animals which you see in any other zoo in India is what they have here. Its high time the zoo management should go abroad nearby Singapore zoo which must be less then half the size of this zoo and learn new techniques and vision to install this birds an animal in more attractive way .
Wilayat,5,Travel in metro train and get free to and fro transport from LB Nagar and Nagole metro stations; and also get Rs. 100/- worth redemption coupon for each entry ticket.

For Americans, bargaining is not a thing - how fun it was and amazing deals we received on lots of jewelry items for me to take home to my friends and family. The actual Charminar architecture is breathtaking and is a must-see for anyone in the area."

We had to remove shoes and submit mobile phones before starting the climb. Entire temple complex is built out of milky white marble and looks stunning. The views of Hussain Sagar Lake from the top is mesmerizing. We liked the ambiance and the beautiful decor of Lord Balaji inside the main temple."
Ajit A,4,"This mandir is very well maintained and the rules are also very strict. You can't carry even your mobile inside the mandir. Although, from top you would like to take photos of the city. Auto options are limited and if you miss it then you will have to walk till the main road to find one. Whatever be the case, this temple should not be missed."
Oneil,4,Very pretty temple which encompasses several faiths & religions. Strategically located on top of a hill which overlooks the entire city.Very clean. Very thoughtful of the management to provide soft mats on the marble floor & steps which makes it very convenient to walk on rather than burning your soles.
Sandeep Bhojani,3,"The authorities are good in terms of maintaining things but we had been on a sunday that too in christmas vacation, so it was very crowded. It is difficult to find few locations of the animals although you can see them in them in the Map on the main road. As when you move inside from the main road there are very few guiding maps who would suggest you the way. Toilets are pay and use and there is additional fee for aquarium, noctrunal animals, fossil mueseum etc. A good place to visit but avoid on public holidays and summer hot days as need to walk a lot if u want to explore all the animals, as the electric car and the mini train would not offer you sights of important animals like lion, tiger etc"
Biswajeet M,5,"It was nice time to spend in RFC. Excellent service by all.but one day can't cover all area but the place which we covered it's awesome ,will visit again "
Vikas D,5,Amazing boat ride and view of the Buddha statue. We were expecting smelly lake but fortunately it was not and it was an enjoyable evening with business colleague Nice weekend getaway
Alok Kumar,5,Visit the hussain sagar lake in evening.. take a stroll. Enjoy the light and sound show... take a boat ride .. and it will be a different experience... something new.. away from hustle bustle of mega city 
Voyage59979330144,4,The rides were amazing and the quality of pool was nice and the overall rides and staff was coperative with the guest 
Machotraveller,4,The Hussein Sagar lake is a prominent landmark of Hyderabad. You can either walk leisurely along the lake side and take in the wide vistas of the city or go to the boating area which has a garden a food courts too. Take one of the boat tours which take to you to the tall Buddha statue in the centre of the lake. In the evening the statue is lighted up and is mesmerising.You may go in the larger boat as part of the crowd or also hire a smaller one for exclusive or family use. A wonderful place to spend an evening.

S R V,4,"NTR gardens near Hussain Sagar Lake is a garden where children go round to enjoy their outings on week days. For people like us aged above 60s it was a leisure place where we could see cactus gardens, beautiful lawns etc."
Michael M,5,"We were in Hyderabad for work but I was taken with colleagues to the Fort so I could see some of Hyderabad not just do work.The old (800+ years old) decorative carving showing the connection to what is now called Iran was incredible.There are several locations that have perfect acoustics - experiencing them is the only way to give it justice as words fail. For example there is a spot where if you clap you can hear an echo but walk two steps away from that spot and there is no echo. The age of the Fort is comparable to the early Norman kings of England - I had no idea that buildings like this existed in India that far back.There is a lot to see, and a lot to climb - depending on how adventurous you are you could climb to the top mosque.Alas there is a entry fee for Indians and a much higher fee for foreigners......"

Gerado Clausell Cabtavella,5,"1st place in the world to visit, too many locations tlthose make the movies, uncountable picture you can take that it seems like you're on another countries"
The Route Edit,4,"This was my second visit to the fort. Last time we visited we didn't have time for the light and sound show so this time I made it a point to stay back for it. The fort itself is very beautiful provided you like historical places or else it would seem brick and mortar debri. Take a registered guide and remember to bargain for the rate coz without a guide it might seem boring. The view from the top is worth the climb and do check the amazing architectural acoustics of the fort. Coming to the light and sound show, I would suggest you give it a miss. They give you a complimentary odomos tube with the tickets so you can imagine the amount of mosquitoes you are about to face during the show. You will be so busy battling mosquitoes that the real battle stories wouldn't seem that interesting. I sat there and dozed off for a major part of the show. I like history and have watched lots of light and sound shows but I guess this experience wasn't that great for me. "
Santkal,5,Awsome place to visit as it gives very nice view on night as it gets filled with so much lights in night.
Roving62608674927,4,All rides are good n the water slides are goodBut should have warm water in parks n showerIt is very important please note
sramanujamk,5,A must place to visit with children. Take a guide and learn both history and acoustic engineering mastered by our ancestors before the invention of electrical sound systems and communications! The whispering wall and alert arena are must-watch.
SSDNY,2,The lake looks very pretty but as you get close you will find the smell. I am wondering if the guest complains about the hotels on the lake.  Shame on the municipality of Hydrabad for not doing anything.
sanjeevtk02,4,"A huge campus, beautiful sets, good presentation of art of film making, audience involvement, the full entertainment package. It's a full-day show, on the outskirts of Hyderabad. Must watch for kids. Descent food choices. Be cautious with elderly as they lack sufficient wheel chairs, support, elderly friendly ramps. Carry sufficient water and be prepared for a good walk and good time"
Jatin Divecha,5,"The architecture of Golconda Fort is awe-inspiring. The complex is spread over a vast area and is surrounded by imposing walls that offer a glimpse into the grandeur of its past. The fort features impressive gateways, massive bastions, and numerous beautifully crafted structures, including the Royal Palace, Durbar Hall, and the Taramati Mosque. The strategic layout of the fort showcases intelligent planning, with various levels, intricate water supply systems, and defensive mechanisms that were ahead of their time."

Mayank G,5,"This overall Ramoji Rao Film City tour experience like watching huge budget film on big screen . This tour is full of action, emotion, drama, music and dance . Just Amazing and unique place. But in my opinion this tour must be two days because only one whole day you can not cover this huge area . Nevertheless one day trip is also enjoyable. This is one trip where you can understand the process of film making . Lovely! Total Blockbuster Place."
Marianne S,5,"God place for have a nice time with family and friends.Animals lives in good conditions, –∞ll zoo looks like a beautiful park. "
Arun Karthik,5,"Also called as Hyderabad Zoo, Nehru Zoological Park was established in the year 1959 but it was only in 1963 when it got opened for public. A must-visit for animal lovers, this zoo houses around 250 species of fauna. All the animals are kept in surroundings similar to their natural atmosphere. Spanning across an area of 300 acres, it has species of Indian rhino, Bengal tiger, Indian elephant, python, panther, Asiatic lion, gaur, antelopes, deer, Himalayan Black Bear and number of birds as its inmates. A number of animals from zoo across the country have been brought here showcasing the variety of wildlife it inhabitants.Few added attractions for children and visitors include Natural History Museum, Toy Train, Aquarium, Butterfly Park, Jurassic Park, and Children‚Äôs Park. It happens to be the first zoo that started off with the idea of Safari Park and successfully established the Lion Safari Park. This park has been extended to a Safari complex also including Bear Safari, Tiger Safari, and Bison Safari. Proper eating amenities are provided for visitors including a multi-cuisine food court, canteen,dairy parlour and bakery.Moreover, Mir Alam Tank that is situated next to this zoological park draws a number of people due to boating activity conducted by the Andhra Pradesh Tourism Department."
SAMRAT84,5,"i visited this place three times in last 10 years because you will never feel bored with this place.really amazing place to visit with your family i am mentioning family because alone you will not enjoy the fullest.i visited the place in the month of december,i will recommend everyone to vsit in dec last week or january first week because in this time they do special events for new year celebration.the place is really very neat and clean and the events are awesome.entry time is 8am and closing time depends upon events varies between 7pm to 8pm,please reconfirm with official website about the timings.you will find everything there like fake movie shooting,fake railway plateform,airport and if you are lucky enough than u can see live shooting of a movie.in 12 hours of journey inside the ramoji premises u will not get bored for a single moment.i will not recommend this place if someone is ill or having issue with long walking as in many places you have to walk alot because during site seeing you have to walk where bus can not proceed.overall in my opinion this is the place where everyone should go at least once in his lifetime."
Suresh K,4,Very much enjoyed with Family. Very large place to cover. Inside commuting is very good. You can spend the whole day is not enough to cover everything. Very much interesting to watch how they filming. 
panii2015,5,Its very good for Kids especially who is interested in science and physics. And its museum also. Should have leisure time to spent here.
Tubby,1,"Caves, wild west, birds show, and space yatra good showsBut Buses force you to go from one spot to anther and there is no option to go directly to the starting point I would specifically call out Sangam restaurant that forces one to pay rs350/head for unlimited food!! They need to learn from Chowki Dhani, Jaipur how unlimited food is served!! They go around the tables to serve people and people eating dont have to go again n again to get smthing! Worst is on reaching the buffet spot, you may not even find the dish you came for ü´§. Plus, Ramuji and family, when you source out to these caterers do you even chk what they are serving and how? Do you eat rasam in a thali at your home? My suggestion.. ramuji and family, plz come to this place as a tourist and then share your review as well!!!"
shilpi j,5,"Birla temple is for sure a must visit while in Hyderabad. Being a local i have visited this place couple of times and always find it neat and calm. Unlike other temples three management here is good and you get ample time for darshan without any pushing and things alike. Also, u have an option of buying the prasad ladoo, which is very nice. I never miss it. There view from the temple is surreal overlooking lake. All in all its a nice and beautiful places to spend some quality time in peace."

OnAir36822321262,5,This was the first time for me to have an experience in amusement park. It was an awesome experience. I literally enjoyed every adventure...especially  reverse roller coaster. 
AjithBhaskaran,4,Good view of the city from the Mandir. They do not allow mobiles inside but the way they manage the mobile safekeep is commendable. The place can get crowded on weekends and holidays. Lumbini Park is nearby but not a ‚Äòmust visit‚Äô.
Rajani B,2,This used to be a beautiful lake adjoining a nice park when I had visited the place some 10 years back. But was really disappointed to see its state now. Lake is very poorly maintained. Lots of thrash on the lake bank. Water of the lake polluted. Authorities need to pay attention to cleanliness.
LostMySelfTraveling,5,"As soon as we went inside we took tickets and also for electric buggies. So that we can go around the zoo park easily. It's a lovely zoo park. There are many visitors come here in holidays from several parts of India. There are wide varieties of wild animals that include while tiger, white peacocks and very big size in macaws ( Similar to parrots but large in size). There is an exclusive fish aquarium too with a separate entrance ticket. You can also rent bicycles for an hour or so. The bicycles must be checked before taking for rent. Overall its a great experience with little kids."
SaiKumar,5,Beautiful.. monument.. being a Hyderabadi.. I have always loved visiting..this place with friends and family.
Ruzan Desai,5,The Golconda fort is a great place for spending half a day. It is recommended to take the government approved guides( INR 750) to understand the true essence of the place. The guides are helpful with showing the stellar architectural nuances of whispering walls and echo points. It is worth climbing to the top of the fort. It is about 400 steps each way. The city view is excellent from there- panoramic in every sense of the word. There is a stall on the top with basic water and chocolates which provides adequate replenishments.
Oneil,3,Good-looking structure.  Could have been better if maintained properly and access should have been easier.
Raman G,4,"We visited the fort as part of our holiday to Hyderabad.  It is part of your sightseeing itinerary.  Managed by Archaeology Survey of India. We did not take a guide. ( as compared, for Agra fort you surely need a guide). It is mainly a walk in the grounds and a abt 300 step walk to the highest point in the fort open for tourists. As Senior Citizens,  we did  walk to the top. It is tiring. Did it at a slow pace. The main attraction is the view from the top."
Mommywannatravel,5,Good place to go with family in the evening. 20 rupees entry ticket and 100 for mobile photography. Took a ride to the buddha statue and back. Overall a good experience
Shankar Duddeda.,1,"Totally maintenance was absolutely gone down, train is not working,kids playing things are stopped, few years ago it was good but now it's looks like only couple park not like family or kids.  Garden maintenance is totally gone .  "

BhautikVVaidya,5,"This science center is one of its kind. It has objects related to history, science, space and dinosaurs. The trip is definitely worth the money. The most unique part is the history section in which there are idols that are older than 1000 years! The ground floor had many experiments, which show the workings of scientific principles in a practical sense. The 1st floor had models of the part of Antarctica which is controlled by India and had the model of the sunken city of Dwarka (very informative). The 2nd level had the bones and information on Dinosaurs and other animals that lived with the dinosaurs. The museum has a lot to show and see so it could be completed in about 3 hours. We have visited many Science Museums, and we can surely say that the history and Dinosaur section is better than those at most places."
TANISHK REDDY,5,Golconda is one of the iconic sites in Telengana state. I visited on a cool day and the views of Hyderabad hitech City was very good. It's a must visit place for all ages.
ullacarinquiterio,4,It was a nice experience to take a boat ride to the statue and walk around it. The best time is in the evening when it is dark and the statue lights up in different colors.

Memoirs-Sachin,4,"The Birla Science museum is a collection of artifacts, models & memorabilia. The tour is very informative. The exhibits are spread across 4 floors & takes about 1-2 hours to visit. It is located very close to the Birla Mandir & can be clubbed in a single visit."
SPillai,3,A large area with a number of animal and bird varieties. But maintenance and upkeep leaves a lot to be desired. Visitor amenities can also be improved significantly.
Qkahmed,5,The Nehru Zoological Park is the second largest animal and birds park stretched across several square kilometers. The zoo houses all animals and birds from India and overseas. The zoo is famous for its white tiger and lion safari park. It also has an animal and bird museum. A great place for tourist and children to watch almost all species of animals and birds.

FIRDOUS (ARMAAN),5,In my visit as solo I got all the information from staffs they were really good. It's clean I don't like the safari trip animal was always hiding.you need at least 3 to 4 hours to see all. The best part of this zoo is bird paradise where all the birds are free and we are allowed to go inside.
HARISH,4,nice and big garden...you can visit full garden via a small train in ntr garden with a nominal fee..
Mdeweyer,3,The statue on the island in the middle of the lake is impressive. The lake is dirty and the boat just takes you from the park to the island and back. Takes 15 minutes.
casandeep,5,If you are visiting Hyderabad this place you must visit. Though you will have to walk a lot but its worth to do so.  Taking a guide along is must if you really want to understand the rich history and the beautiful architecture. How things were visualized 500 years back is simply unbelievable.
Manoj43_11,4,A massive lake in the centre of Hyderabad city is good to visit in the evening time. Large statue of Lord Buddha in the lake is main attraction. The park is also nice and you can spend some time here or go for boating.
Shailendra,3,Hussain sagar lake used to be a place to visit on our weekend drives when we came to Hyderabad in 2003 but over the last few years the lake has deteriorated due to lack of cleaning and resultant smell.No more a place worth a watch.

jojo,4,We visited the fort in the noon time. Ticket was Rs 25 per adult. It was almost crowded. But it was properly maintained. The fort was very beautiful and has historical importance. Having a majestic look spread over with memories of the past. Excited crowds being busy with photographs and the excellent scenic background.Guides were available.
vikram a,3,difficult to travel with kids the area of the zoo is big to cover all animals no food inside the park
ShvRm_Traveller,4,"It is a man made lake, built some time in 16th Century and which separates Hyderabad from Sikanderabad.

A van took us to different points like Alauddin ride, shows about making the movie, sets where each entrance was a different building etc. The guide was charming and explained the significance of different spots along with the famous movies directed there. The gardens were spacious and well maintained. The best part of the trip was the Bahubali set. We loved the magnificent ensemble."

moogul818,5,"It is one such place of worship where a sense of calm descends on you as you enter. Located at a relative height on the bank of the Hussain Sagar lake, the temple offers a good view. It is neat clean and well managed.You are not harassed by vendors and once you are on the steps of the temple you can be on your own.I would recommend it for a visit when in Hyderabad."

Road62049353623,2,"The entry fee and food inside  are too costly. For a four member family, if you just ignore this place, you could visit almost all other tourist attractions in Hyderabad with the same expenditure if you have visited this film city. This place is definitely not for budget tight family. Entry fee of 200 rs for adult and 100 rs for child  are just good enough."
Chandra J,5,Easy trek up hillside unless you have problems navigating stairs.  Great views of the city and of the whole area.  Helpful with a guide so you know what you're looking at

Vikas Singh,5,"Beautifully maintained, the temple is perched on a small hill top. It makes creative use of the rocks and the hill side. Views from the top are breathtaking. Cameras and mobiles are not allowed. You can deposit them in the free locker facility. Go early around 9-10 am before the place starts getting crowded."
KARTHIK I,5,I really love the neatness and maintenance of this place. Chants all over really well managed place. Good seating place and really clean.You can have a good view of tankbund and hyderabad early in the morning from the temple.I recommend everyone to visit atleast once.

itspriyanka,4,"We went on a weekday when school kids were there for picnic. The experiments were good. Our 6 yr old son enjoyed the ones he understood. Some of them were for older kids. Some machines were not working. The dinasorium was good too, with real fossils / bones and real skeleton. We did not visit the doll museum and anthropology section though...And if you are visiting around lunch and do not have your own vehicle, make sure you pack some lunch. Food is allowed inside the museum. There are only some small shacks outside which serve snacks."
SrijitNewYork,,"Went to the Charminar in the early hours of the day (around 7:30am). It was perfect timing. No traffic, no crowds, no bustle in the adjoining markets... Basically, it was easy to get in and out. I've been here three times before and as always, the Charminar was under repairs, this time around too. There was a scaffold around three sides of the monument. So a good selfie wasn't possible. However, it felt good to walk around it and have an Irani tea and a wedge of Dilkhush (bread stuffed with dried fruits) as an early breakfast from one of the many tea shops in the area. I hung around for less than an hour before heading over to my next destination. "

Traveler23278189143,5,It was amazing trip and we loved all the rides must go and fun food was great staff were really helpful 
bhaskara,3,"A very crowded place with roadside shops. Also, the issue with beggars, they simply touch you and don't leave until you Pay. Avoid going there on Weekends or festival times. Be careful with your mobile and money. No proper maintenance and respect for tourists in this area. 
The view is good from inside and outside Charminar. The only issue is no maintenance and officials seem to get used to it, so they don't care about beggars and robbers who are troubling travelers. 
Use only Ola or Uber if you are traveling alone or with family. Autowala charges double the cost here. 
Old age people, avoid climbing Charminar. The steps are very deep and the width is very small. They will inform you only at the entry, so you may lose money if you decide not to climb after purchasing tickets. "
AbhiMone,5,A well maintained park with many rides to keep children and adults engaged .  It's very big and walking tour takes 3 to 4 hrs
Sajid,4,"The building, the structure is awe-inspiring and to think that it stands there for more than 4 centuries is amazing. What disappoints though is the fact that like most of the places in India, this monument is also not being maintained properly. I fail to understand, why do we find it so difficult to maintain our heritage. This is such an amazing piece of architecture, yet the neglect from authorities is glaring."
Varun Pursnani,4,"My cousin and I came here for a short visit as we were late for planetarium and surprisingly it was so good from inside that we continued our tour for a much longer time.For science, mathematics, astronomy etc. different different topics each concept was explained very nicely and creatively.Overall it was a very enjoyable and worth our time!!"
Lokesh1981,5,"A very big garden cum park in front of Hussain sagar lake, one of the prominent attraction of Hyderabad, one can see Buddha statue and Birla temple both, Nicely maintained, many varieties of flowers, many options for children to play, haunted house, many rides, water tunnel etc, The best part is one toy train which gives a glimpse of entire park, In nutshell best place to enjoy time with family and friends specially kids, "
Vaishnavi_g,5,"Dont ask a local hyderabi about visiting this place. They say, what is there in it !!! But believe me it is really wonderful for an outsider. You will be taken through a guided tour, and you will get to see cine-settings, best of it is, Bahubali setting, Mahabharata, Ramyana... Then you will have a 4D show... Eco park where for the first time I saw the birds , geese etc left to freely fly around although inside a fenced area. You can just walk through them...Got to hold a maccaw in hand.... And adventure rides.... Worth giving an entire day for it.     Dont bother if a local says, dont waste your one day on it. Just go for it. It is worth going atleast once here. "
Primal Survivor,3,The major attraction of the city . Designed for families outings. The lake is littered with muck. Strange smell follows. Upgradation process is on causing traffic snarls . Only if response tourism was followed . Sad the visitors don't care. 
73prashantha,4,Not as good as Vishweshwarraya museum in Blore. They repeat the same stuff over and over again.Worth visiting once.
HARISH,4,nice and big garden...you can visit full garden via a small train in ntr garden with a nominal fee..
Kishore W,2,Its but on a grand  scale but ppl dobt maintain cleanliness at all  they litter everywhere...and hardly use garbage cans...the toy train was fun..but wish ppl start realizing the importance of cleanliness
Ashish G,4,"Ramoji Film City is a wonderful experience and a must visit. I'll list down some delighters and things that can be improved based on my experience.  Pros first1. Lots of things to do and experiences to have. 2. The shows are very impressive. Spirit of Ramoji, Wild West were in particular very nice. 3. There were a good amount of rides for children and adults to enjoy. 4. The eco park was very good, especially the bonsai collection was amazing to see. 5. Haunted house was a good experience for kids. Things that can be improved1. The brochure was very confusing. There is no way you can cover all the things in Ramoji in a day, so the brochure should give more detailed information which helps the people to choose based on their interest. 2. We took the star experience package which was the more expensive one. However they kept passing us from one person to other person without anyone explaining what is the plan for the day. Even on asking they were not interested to answer and just kept pointing to someone else. It felt we missed out on lots of things simply because no-body told us. Also the bus was so overcrowded that everyone did not even got a seat and lots of time was wasted in sorting that out. The star experience didn't feel worth the money and I felt I would have been better off with a regular ticket and planning the day myself, rather than leaving it to the star experience providers. 3.  Don't think this falls under the jurisdiction of Ramoji, but the travel to and from Ramoji was a big headache. We booked a ticket via BestBus which seemed to show on their site that they are the official partners with Ramoji. However it was a bad experience, as they kept asking us to change pickup point without realizing how difficult it would be for someone to reach different pickup point at short notice. Even while drooping off they didn't drop us at our designated dropping point. I would strongly suggest giving BESTBUS a skip and find another option to reach there."
Ratan,5,Very rich Architecture and good to see the affordable price for purchase of Laccar bangles and other textile materials nearby.
EASWAR52,3,"Golconda fort is one of the very old structures in Hyderabad. This is spread over a huge area. Here we can enjoy the beauty of olden constructions, their architectural richness and their technological knowledge. The complex is provided with a compound wall of olden times all-round which gives a clear picture of the past life.It contains past structures which includes gate ways, bastions, royal palace, durbar hall etc which takes us to the past era. The water supply system present here and defensive mechanisms provided are really wonderful.Here one can experience the perfect acoustics provided in the structures. The fort displays past history. Last but not the least is the fact that one must be ready to walk for long distances to cover the vast area of the fort.Overall, it is worth spending time in the fort to understand the past and to gauge the technological richness of India in the olden days.Great experience."
None I,2,"Such a great gift of nature to the Hyderabad city and particularly the Madhapur and Gachibowli area but it's a pity that the lake won't live for long.  There is dirt and filth all around. It's getting converted to a drainage, a garbage dumping area.  I was very disappointed to see this state of a natural resource."
madhavi2022,5,read up before you go - guides are scalpers. Reach early to dodge the heat and crowds! Mask up as poor social distancing
Aditi A,2,Superb place and great shows . The only and major draw back is that they are not wheelchair accessible. Thats something basic .
Tarun,4,We visited here on my younger son's birthday with family. We first enjoyed the Lumbani Park and took tickets for boat ride on kids demand. We went upto the Lord Buddha statue. Children enjoyed there for sometime. We took many selfies. It is good to photography and visit with children. All of us enjoyed a lot.
Najeeb Ahmad,5,"Charminar is an iconic monument located in the heart of Hyderabad, India. It is a famous tourist attraction that draws visitors from all over the world. The monument was built in 1591 and has since become a symbol of the city's rich history and culture. 
The structure is a beautiful example of Islamic architecture, with four minarets that rise to a height of 56 meters. The monument is surrounded by a bustling market known as Laad Bazaar, where visitors can shop for traditional clothing, jewelry, and handicrafts. 
Charminar is well-maintained and provides a range of facilities to visitors, including audio guides, restrooms, and drinking water facilities. The monument's interior is not open to visitors, but the stunning exterior is a sight to behold. The area around Charminar is vibrant and lively, with street food stalls selling delicious local delicacies. Visitors can also explore the nearby historical landmarks such as the Mecca Masjid and the Chowmahalla Palace. 
The monument is open to visitors from 9:30 am to 5:30 pm every day, and there is a small entrance fee for non-Indian visitors. 
Overall, Charminar is a must-visit tourist destination that showcases the rich cultural heritage of Hyderabad. The monument's stunning architecture and the bustling market around it make for a memorable experience for visitors. ----------------------- ‚úçÔ∏èüì∏mr_najeeb_07 "

Praveen K,5,"Visit to this magnificent fort is incomplete without attending light & sound show in the evening, which tells the story of fort and the city"
Murali M,3,"We went to Zoo on Christmas day 2018 and as expected it got crowded as the day progressed. We reached there early and good thing we did, as we didn't have to wait for battery car or train or long queue at entrance. Few changes from last time I visited.1. They used to allow our own vehicles inside, Now you have to park and remember to reach early if you are going on a public holiday or weekend.2. No plastic allowed inside. Any plates, covers, bags are strictly prohibited. 3. Best time to reach there is 9:00 AM. 4. Don't expect much in safari. There is nothing to it and I recommend you skip it unless you hear of any improvements/changes.5. Vast area so be prepared to walk even though you have rented battery car, they operate from point to point but you still need to walk around quite a bit.Overall, I feel neatness has improved with plastic and vehicle ban, having said that what this zoo needs is more animals :-) Hope they can bring in more attractions as it has potential to go long way."

Vaishnavi_g,,"Charminar looks well maintained from outside. Impressive structure. But not worth going in and climbing up. Interiors are not well maintained. You get pigeon smell. I guess the whole hype around charminar is for the huge flee markets and other shopping areas around it. Where you you can shop just everything from clothes, pearls, bangles and other collectibles. Otherwise you can just watch this on postcard. Not worth investing time. "
Mutukuloju Pranay,4,"Beautiful lake with the statute of buddha at the center .much contaminated,[polluted.you can see the watercolor is black and green.need to cleaned first"

Raja vishnu vardhan Reddy (visrey),5,Seeing Charminar in a normal time is just like attending a fair with thousands of people bustling without even inch space. Best way to see Charminar without the crowd is visiting it after 12 though you can't actually enter inside charminar late night but it's a good measure to avoid crowd because of the covid and you can see no one wearing a mask in your vicinity if you are there in normal times.
Mukta2016,4,The NT Ramarao garden in Hyderabad is a nice garden located along one section of the bank of Hussain Sagar Lake and gives a nice view of the lake. The garden has many visitors cumming in the evening for a pleasant time.
Santosh K,5,Nice and awsome view to be seen and must witnessed on night as it gives an awesome and very attractive view on night.
casandeep,5,If you are visiting Hyderabad this place you must visit. Though you will have to walk a lot but its worth to do so.  Taking a guide along is must if you really want to understand the rich history and the beautiful architecture. How things were visualized 500 years back is simply unbelievable.
Sardev2014,4,Worth a visit and buy a guide if you can. Charminar is a four pillared historic site that is accessed via steep and narrow steps. There are two levels but you can only access the first level. Views are spectacular and give nice overview of Hyderabad 
Amol S,1,"We visited this place with lot of expectations but were left very disappointed with overall experience!Total ticket cost for family of 2 adults and 2 kids was 5400 for absolutely nothing worth mentioning to see Horror starts right from beginning when u are asked to park car 5 kms away from main premise. From there all tourists are put in outdated buses like prisoners and taken to main film city area .So once you are in you just can not leave place without going through entire torture. Guided tour lasts only about 30 mins and after that you are left there from point to point to explore nothing. Adventure sports area sports like paintball , archery are all useless. For paintball just one person standing there asking u to shoot 3 shots on target . Archery session arch set looks like it is third class china toy bought at 100 from local market. That also only one ser is there. In short what is included in ticket is all useless stuff but advertised by Mr Ramoji as if its out of the world Sahaj adventure sports .For kids only space yatra which lasted for 5 mins and bird park was only area worth mentioning.In addition like prisoners you are not allowed to carry any food inside . Firstly with exorbitant ticket cost now they like are further allowed to take more money from your pocket.Restaurant called Jimmy is total useless with third grade food at five star prices .Worst is you cant leave place as you are stuck there !!Pls avoid avoid and donate money to some needy !!!"
Srinu,5,The only best place in world that is wonderla. We visited to this place many times but it never bores us all the rides are amazing and the service is the best from management like everytime.
sanjib c,5,Had a wonderful experience. The place was very well maintained and the tour guides are very well informed about the place. staff are very helpful and the food served in the restaurants are good.I would however suggest the management to be a bit more strict on the littering by the visitors in the park. It was a shame to see educated people littering the place with water bottles and disposal bags. 
Brijendra Singh B,5,Architect quality is excellent but area around this place is not very clean. Lot of small shops have mushroomed around the area.

People throw garbage here and there, making reels, dancing and all. everyone is living and loving these place only for the Views."

Must watch for kids. Descent food choices. Be cautious with elderly as they lack sufficient wheel chairs, support, elderly friendly ramps. Carry sufficient water and be prepared for a good walk and good time"

Andrew D,4,"Compared with other forts in India, Golconda is not particularly different but it does have a good view of the surrounding areas from the top. That being said, I would still recommend a visit to the Golconda Fort for a taste of how lives must have been during the nizam's times."
vasant agshikar,5,I visited the fort and took a guide who provided me good enough about the fort. It is advisable you negotiate with the guide .the fort is well maintained and one can enjoy the view from various levels of the fort. The view from the top most point of the is awesome. The 700 step well is an uphill tasks if your having health issues like heart BP etc kindly avoid taking the stairs. The architectural is amazing and the science behind construction is also an interesting subject to study to know how advance we were then. It would take you 2 hrs to cover the entire area with enough rest and photography.
dr ganapathi bhat,5,"Pristine and huge structure made of marble. At a height, so gives a good city view and an outstanding Hussain Sagar lake view.Vast car parking. There are some steps to climb, but lift is available. Employees are very friendly.Idol of Lord Venkateshwara is magnificent. There are also idols of different dieties that are simply superb.No entry fee. Camera is not allowed  inside the Mandir. There is a counter to keep your belongings.  Hand bag and purse are permitted. About 45 minutes would suffice to cover the entire Mandir.  Inside, a serene feeling should be felt to be believed.An idol shop in  the premises can be visited.  In Hyderabad, don't miss Birla Mandir. Best to go in the night. "

OctOriental,4,"Straightaway you get a feel of history of an old fort. It looks good as well, spanning a great distance from left to right. But do beware, there are several spots where the guards warn you not to venture into as some stone structures have loosened up and could collapse. Some people disregard the warnings. Well...The fort has toilets. Climbing a few steps does afford good views. But you could go all the way up. Guides are there everywhere and could try to inveigle you by authoritatively directing you away from your chosen path as if it's not the way to go. It's easy to shake them off. Just ignore. But if you have a lot of time to spend there and are interested in history, apocryphal or not, maybe a guide could be helpful. But at the entrance there's a stone with brief history inscribed on it. Do read it to get some first hand history."
Saurabh M,4,"Exploring Telangana........Hyderabad..... At the famous Golkonda fort......How to reach can take a auto or ola directly there....... Golconda Fort Hyderabad is an outstanding example of brilliant engineering and magical architecture. Located at a distance of 11km from the city, it is the most famous of all Hyderabad tourist places. The name of the fort has been derived from the Telugu words ""Golla"" and ""Konda"" which together means 'Shepherd's Hill'.An impressive structure, which once, would have bewitched every onlooker, stands majestically even today. Golconda Fort is sure to impress you with not only with that highly advanced techniques were used back then and sturdy structure, but also with an outstanding view of the surrounding city.Founded in the approximately 12th Century by the Kakatiya Kings, this massive Golconda Fort with eight gates and 87 bastions was later built by Qutub Shahi Kings.The name Golconda Fort has a legend behind it. As per the story, a shepherd boy was once walking on this hill when he had come across a God idol. The news about the shepherd boy and his findings reached the then ruler of Kakatiya Dynasty. The King then decided to built a fort on the hill, which then came to be known as Golconda (Shepherd‚Äôs Hill) Fort.However, almost 200 years later, the fort came under Bahamani rulers. Later Qutub Shahi Kings took the fort under their control and extended it further. The fort was fortified and expanded during the reign of Bahamani rulers and Qutub Shahi Dynasty. Later in 1687, this fort came under the rule of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. It was then the fort was left unattended.At present, the Golconda Fort constitutes a complex layout of palaces, temple mosques and pavilion, all of which unfortunately are in ruins now.Architecture of Golconda FortWith perimeters of around 11 kilometers, the fort has 15 to 18 foot high walls. It has huge gates that have pointed iron spikes on them. This protected the fort from Elephants damaging the fort as well as enemy attacks. Golconda fort presents a mesmerizing architecture which will astonish you at each and every step. This fort has been built on a granite rock with a height of 12 meters. Huge rampart around the golconda fort was built, a glimpse of which can still be seen.The system of acoustics in the Fort is something which attracts each and every visitor. The sound of clapping at the entrance can be heard at the ‚ÄòBala Hissar' which is the highest point and almost a kilometre away. This system was apparently used for communication purposes, especially to alert royal in case of any attack.Other attractive features of the Fort include water supply system which does leave many marvelling at the advancement of the technical and scientific knowledge while constructing this fort. Another popular aspect is the 'Rahban' cannon.Ramdas‚Äô prison is one of the popular spots inside the fort. According to legend, Ramdas who was a revenue collector in Abdul Hasan Shah's court was imprisoned. During his imprisonment, he carved Hindu deities on the wall of his cell. One can see many carvings of Hindu Lord Hanuman on the wall, which are now smeared with holy vermillion. A holy lamp or two (diyas) is also kept lit in front of the carvings."

Suresh1976,5,"We had visited this place in Dec. we had a wonderful time in this zoo and my kids enjoyed a lot. This zoo is very big, has lot of animals and different types of birds, reptiles, small fish aquarium.Animals like Cheetah, leopard, tiger, wolf, jackal, hyena, elephants, giraffe, ostrich, we found lots of deer. They have kept different types of birds, peacocks etc. in reptiles we have seen some crocodiles and different types of snakes.It is nicely maintained and it is very clean. Before the entrance there is the proper checking where staff don‚Äôt allow anyone to carry plastic bags inside the zoo. After the entrance you will find a mini van service which is quite good if you have old age people with you or if your kids are very small who cannot walk long distance. Zoo is spread in the vast area where you need to walk a long distance to cover all the animals.After the entrance there is toy train also. Ticket is very reasonable. Rs 20 for adult and Rs.10 for child. I advise you to take this toy train, kids will enjoy a lot. It covers the complete zoo area in 25 mins.There is Safari service also but we skipped it because of lot of rush. So better go early so that you don‚Äôt miss this safari service.You will not find much eateries inside. You will find ample drinking water and public toilets inside the zoo at various places.You will require full day to enjoy complete zoo but we spent 4 hours and skipped some of the places.We had a wonderful time in this zoo."
Tarun,5,"Really enjoyed the zoo by visiting along with my 8 years and 5 years old kids. Main attractions were the tigers, lion, elephants, hippo, rhino, ostrich etc. Big zoological park which we felt little uncomfortable to walk around.

Some good architecture and writingson the walls . Its a must visit. A bit run down. Ammonia odour on the steps which go down. Authorities must lok into that.

Kaushik G,5,"We had visited Ramoji Film City on a day tour during our holiday in Hyderabad. We had booked tickets online through Makemytrip priced at 1150 rupees per person and collected physical tickets from the counter at Ramoji Film City. Once inside the gate, a bus took us to the actual amusement park area. There was a grand welcome show with song and dance at 9.45 am. Next we boarded their red bus for a grand tour which took us to different locations like Bahubali movie set, Japanese Gardens, London street, Butterfly park, Bird park, Kripalu caves and many more. In the 2nd half we attended different mind boggling shows out of which the best was the Spirit of Ramoji show. In between we squeezed time for burgers and fries. To sum it up, this was surely one of the great experience to cherish for a lifetime."

Abhinav,5,"Yes,the mission interstellar and roller coaster was amazing I will again visit wonderla it was super experience to our family"
Nitin A,3,"Parking is a hassle - small parking space , uphill road to get to the parking which is usually blocked by visitors. The access road to the temple is also very narrow.The marble of the temple needs serious renovation. Cameras and phones are required to be deposited outside before entering the temple. The temple offers a good view of Hussain Sagar Lake."

Biswajit M,2,"Its not worth visit as its very mundane and old school , its actually a studio being open for tourists who have nothing else to do and only have time to waste and spend money"
Atharva,4,It was a wonderful experience. All the rides were very good. The water park slides were also very good. The wave pool was amazing
Jay-Raghu-2016,5,"This was my 3rd visit to CharMinar. The only difference was it was a evening and on a Sunday.Absolutely packed by shoppers, vendors and traffic. Managed to park about 400 meters away. Great photo opportunities. Charminar was well lit and glowing. Recommend a day and evening visit after sunset."
Kaushik G,4,"During our holiday in Hyderabad, we had visited the Birla Science Center which is located in the same complex as Birla Planetarium. Entrance tickets are priced at 100 rupees per person. There are 4 levels: Level-0 has the dolls Museum and other collections, Level-1 has different exhibits showcasing different principles of physics including optical illusion, Level-2 showcases the submerged city of Dwarka and more attractions, Level-3 houses a giant skeleton of a dinosaur which was excavated in this region. It was a great experience visiting this place."
skychaserCalgary,5,"Very historical place, walked up to the top and back down again‚Ä¶.superb views of the city from on the top"
Journeyscribe,4,A piece of history located very close to Darga road. You must walk atleast for 1hour+ to get the full experience 
doug m,5,"Fascinating old fort with extensive fortifications. Allow plenty of time for the long and very hot climb to the top where extensive views are to be had, including the nearby tombs (which are also worth a visit)."
ullacarinquiterio,3,The fort was a nice experience but the biggest disappointment was that there is no  sound and light show as it is under repairs and no-one can tell when it will start again. 
chandrasekhar g,4,Visited during kharitabad ganesh utsav time.NTR gardens near to kharitabad ganesh utsav.Entry ticket is available.Photography is allowed inside garden.Games are available.
Farook Uddin,4,"Spreads over 380 acres of land, the zoo is managed by the Forest Department of the Government of Andhra Pradesh, Don't Carry polythene bags, bedsheets, knifes. They are not allowed. Reach early to buy tickets you won't get it online and especially on weekends there is huge crowd and long queues. I would suggest better visit on weekdays if you want peace. :-) "
sramanujamk,5,A must place to visit with children. Take a guide and learn both history and acoustic engineering mastered by our ancestors before the invention of electrical sound systems and communications! The whispering wall and alert arena are must-watch.
Yashaswi,5,"Interstellar ride was an amazing experience, water rides are also excellent , maintanence of washrooms were soo good."
deepa v,4,Nice place to be with kids.there are shows in different languages hindi Telugu and english at different time slots.The evolution is showed..dinasaur era and all..must visit for kids above 6years.
Chandra J,5,Easy trek up hillside unless you have problems navigating stairs.  Great views of the city and of the whole area.  Helpful with a guide so you know what you're looking at
NITHIN KUMAR CHINTHAKINDI,5,"Golconda Fort, also known as Golkonda is a fortified citadel and an early capital city of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Because of the vicinity of diamond mines, especially Kollur Mine, Golconda flourished as a trade centre of large diamonds, known as the Golconda Diamonds."
Vacation01012081284,5,Trips are so thrilling. Had a wonderful experience. We celebrated our friend's birthday here and the experience was so unique. 
Guide06825819179,5,Wonderla is extremely superb no words to say about Wonderla it's awesome it's a dreamy world  service is nice we taste Britani in wonderla food court it is super delicious
OctOriental,4,"Straightaway you get a feel of history of an old fort. It looks good as well, spanning a great distance from left to right. But do beware, there are several spots where the guards warn you not to venture into as some stone structures have loosened up and could collapse. Some people disregard the warnings. Well...The fort has toilets. Climbing a few steps does afford good views. But you could go all the way up. Guides are there everywhere and could try to inveigle you by authoritatively directing you away from your chosen path as if it's not the way to go. It's easy to shake them off. Just ignore. But if you have a lot of time to spend there and are interested in history, apocryphal or not, maybe a guide could be helpful. But at the entrance there's a stone with brief history inscribed on it. Do read it to get some first hand history."

Lyn V,4,"We visited Charminar with a guide one afternoon and enjoyed seeing the history of the place. We walked up the spiral staircase and enjoyed the view from the top. It was pretty crowded and in particular, the bazaar /markets below. We would recommend seeing this impressive monument built in 1591 and still standing the test of time. It gave us an insight into India's history. üïå"
73prashantha,4,Not as good as Vishweshwarraya museum in Blore. They repeat the same stuff over and over again.Worth visiting once.
Goutam Mandal,4,You can really enjoy the peace and beauty of nature. The view and calmness of the lake will not only provide you peace but cool your mind as well.

skychaserCalgary,5,"Very historical place, walked up to the top and back down again‚Ä¶.superb views of the city from on the top"
Raviraj Rodrigues,5,"The property is built on the lines of Disneyworld, but at a much lower scale and finish quality. However for the entry price, I would say its worth a one time visit. We got to see many sets. both live and ready for shooting. Some of them are permanent like Mughal gardens, Rajput Palaces, Wild West, Indian Village scenes etc. Some others were created for one movie and left for tourists to enjoy like the sets of Bahubali. They have some lovely gardens, bird park and butterfly park too. However, one can truly enjoy the place only by staying inside the filmcity in one of their hotels for atleast 2 nights. There is too much to see and do and the guided tour of 2.5 hours will not do justice to the place. We could spend early mornings and late evening on the sets and gardens as we stayed in the resort and were permitted to move around. "
MyNameIs Shiva,5,If You love buddah You are the one to visit this place it's an historic place an a must watch location In Hyderabad.
abrahamsuji,5,Best green space in Hyderabad. Easy access. Lots of activity for kids. Endless green space to walk around

NAZEER SHAIK,5,Nehru zoological park was one of the most popular visiting places in Hyderabad/Telangana. Nice place to visit
Oneil,4,This is one of the places worth visiting when in Hyderabad. It has been maintained & kept fairly clean & enforced by their vigilant security staff. The only short-coming is the rates fixed by the guides there. INR 1250 charged by them is a little excessive.Electronic audio guides need to be installed by the Government/Management at the earliest.
Vikas Singh,5,"Recognized by United Nations World Tourism Organization as World's largest heart shaped mark, this lake is the most visited site in Hyderabad. Though the lake is highly polluted and stinks at several places it is a wonderful place to spend early morning. On one side is the necklace road and other side is Tank Bund. There are several parks all around the lake- Herbal garden, Butterfly garden, Sanjeevaiah Children park, Rock garden, Rose garden, NTR garden and Lumbini Park. Boats are available from Lumbini Park to Girbraltar Rock on which the colossal monolythic Buddha Statue stands."
TravelEnthusiast,5,"The trip to Nehru Zoological Park is amzing especially when you go with your friends, family and loved ones. You can reach out to here in public transport or Ola / Uber or any other cab. Its a nice zoo park perfectly maintained and organized. It has way boards, maps and directions. You can also take bycicles and buggies. You can take any of them based on your requirement. You can enjoy the trip with so much ease. This saves lot of time, effort and energy.You will find lot of people from Andhra, Telangana and many other states too. The best way I found is to take a ticket at the entrance for buggy. You will enjoy the trip. There are good canteens also in the zoo park. You can buy popcorn üçø, Samosa and ice creams. There are many animals that you will find interesting and curios to know the facts if you carefully read about them.Overall its a nice place to enjoy the trip."
shirin t,5,In the evening no other better place then Hussain Sagar to visit. Boating one of the best feature. Yup delicious street food another amazing stuff. Worth trying for

explorer india,4,"Its a big zoo housing lot of Indian, Asian  and African species of animals in big enclosures including Indian Lions , African Lion , Indian tiger , White Tiger , Cheetah , Leopard, Hippo , Rhino , Elephant , Jirrafe , Crocodile etc... Its a huge trail walking , so one can hire bicycle inside or take a battery cart hop on hop off ride for extra cost. The zoo overall is not that hygenic and the animal enclsures often smell foul. So be sure to carry your hand sanitiser also. Overall the children enjoy seeing so many animals at one place but the place reaaly needs to be better maintained."
Elias M,5,"Large, Beautiful, Fun place to visit with family. One of the best places to visit stepping away from the hustle and bustle of the city and fast life in Hyderabad. Enjoy the cool, calm and beautiful time place with family."
Ravindra V,3,Nothing great except for just few snaps. Bad maintenance. There were some boats but no one to take us for a ride.
Anne R,5,This is a very impressive fort! Very well maintained and very interesting to visit with a very old history. A must if you are in Hyderabad! 
Sightseer63341929622,4,"Me and my friends have enjoyed all the rides in wonderla alot especially we have enjoyed in mission Interstellar space ride , trex twinflip and crazy cars alot we had a great experience in wonderla with my buddies."
Sounak Poddar,,"This is an iconic place in Hyderabad and for some good reasons. Boat ride into the sea for the Budhaa Statue is a ride to remember, and that too also for good and as well as for bad reason. Good reason being the ride and the view and the bad reason for the smell. Anyway one should take a call on your own if you want to visit this place or not."
Shruti tamrakar,1,"The place stinks. literally. very less to do once there, even the boat ride over the dirty waters is overpriced @50 INR and gets over within 10 min. "
Naresh_byra,5,"Majestic and it feels like first time, whenever I visit Charminar. Visited after lockdown and the charm of Charminar is alive but it is not as much crowd as it used to be.The place is getting restoration and it feel good to see our heritage is protected. Must visit place if you are into culture tours."

Ashish S,5,This place is just amazing. It's very beautiful. The place is worth visiting and should be a must visit place during visit to Hyderabad.
LostMySelfTraveling,5,I love this park. It's a fantastic memorial of Shri Naandamuri Taraka Ramarao Ex. CM OF Andhrapradesh. It's a must vist place in Necklace Road. It's also close to Imax multiplex theatre. Children will enjoy the park alot. Very well developed and beautifully maintained park. 
Saurabh M,4,"
Exploring Telangana....... Hyderabad......at Chairminar........Best way to reach is get down at MGBS metro station and take bus or auto..... Or directly auto from anywhere.... 
An identifying feature of the city, Charminar is the most prominent landmark located right in the heart of Hyderabad. The monument was erected by Quli Qutub Shah to signify the founding of Hyderabad. As is evident from the structure, it was so named as it consists of four minarets. Although it lies right in the centre of the city with traffic and crowds milling all about it, Charminar certainly manages to hold the gaze. It is also famous for the market that sprawls around it and is called 'Laad' or 'Chudi' Bazaar. 
Since the construction of the monument in 1591, Charminar has been synonymous with the culture of Hyderabad standing tall as a reminder of the glorious days of the past era. It is a massive structure which has four minarets which many believe stand for the first four 'khalifas' (Prophets) of Islam. Towards the north of the monument, there are four gateways known as Char Kaman which have been constructed in the cardinal directions. The structure was intended to serve as a Madrasa or a Mosque. In its present form, Charminar, has been added to the 'tentative list' of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. 
The structure of Charminar is an exquisite example of Indo-Islamic architecture with Persian influences. The arches and domes of the monument define the influence of Islamic architecture, while the Persian influence is prominent from its minarets. The balconies and the outside walls, embellished with delicate stucco floral ornamentations on the ceiling, showcases the influence of the Hindu style of architecture.At the base of the Charminar is a small temple called as ""Bhagyalakshmi Temple"".... 
The Charminar was built to commemorate the decision and eradication of plague from the city. It is known as Charminar as it is supported by four minarets on four sides which were possibly meant to commemorate the first four caliphs of Islam. The old city of Hyderabad was designed keeping Charminar as the centre of the city. 
According to some legends, Quli Qutub Shahi saw his beloved wife, Baghmati, at this very site. He built Charminar as a symbol of his eternal love for his wife. There is also a legend that talks about the existence of a secret tunnel under the Charminar that connects it to the Golkonda Fort. It was created as a means of escape for the royal family in the time of emergencies. 
Charminar is famous for many things but is most known for the lip smacking dishes and great bargain shopping. There is no better place for shopping in Hyderabad than the area surrounding the Charminar. The streets are brimming with people at all times, with the shops displaying attractive and colourful bangles and jewellery. It is popular for bangles, pearls, jewellery, semi-precious stones, silverware, Kalamkari paintings, sarees, silk materials, gold embroidered fabric, lacquer bangles, ittar and the traditional Khara dupatta. This street is filled with people and haggling is part and parcel of this market..... "
siddharth Rawat,5,It's best to reach here in the morning around 9. The day seems to be short to cover the entire film city. The experience is rich. Must watch being the sound and light show. Ample amount of food joints are available. A day well spent and with rich learning experience.
Alok Kumar,5,"Charminar , the PASSPORT to central India... Hyderabad.. the city of Nizam... It's in a very crowdy place.. surrounding are clasteophobic.. but yes.. it's a myat see place.. it's an icon.. one must visit the icon .. if they are visiting Hyderabad.. "
Aparajita_03,3,"Charminar is an icon of Hyderabad. It is possible to alight up the steep stairs to get a birds eye view of the city. However, the stairs are steep and made in a circular fashion, so aged people or anyone with even slight discomfort in walking should not explore this. The view from top is amazing. The insides are adorned with carvings. The ticket counter closes at 5.30pm. We got our tickets at 5.29 pmso we were lucky that way. The area around charminar is nice for street shopping especially bangles and jewellery."
Sagar P,5,This is really HUGE zoo park . Lot of around 200 different animal species are kept over 350 acre land. Very well maintained .
avixorld,4,Whenever I went to HYD I always tried to visit this water body. This is a good refresher within a city what people can get after the busy schedule of a work day. I loved their passenger boat ride to the Buddha statue. My only issue here the ticket system one can introduce credit card vending machine and there should be some poster which can enhance the awareness of preservation of water body!
Leee,5,"Such nice place to visit once in a life , excellent experience, the last evening I visited a Charminar which is made my day excellent city üåÉ view nice place but little bit rush, I had very good experience in this place thank you so much Hyderabad "
Pioneer15314070080,5,It was very amazing and I loved the experience here and all rides are good and enjoyable and all the fun shows are good too
Kavya Sharma,5,One of the most beautiful and peaceful places of Hyderabad. The vibes of the temple cannot be expressed in words. If you are planning to visit the temple try to go early in the morning or in the evening.
Guide58742276488,5,The experience is good on the adventure side. We have missed dragon adventure because of some technical problem remaining thing are very good especially food is very good.
Journeyscribe,4,"A well known visiting spot in Hyderabad, close to Hussain sagar and neckless road. Gets quite busy during the evening. "
Michael M,5,"We were in Hyderabad for work but I was taken with colleagues to the Fort so I could see some of Hyderabad not just do work.The old (800+ years old) decorative carving showing the connection to what is now called Iran was incredible.There are several locations that have perfect acoustics - experiencing them is the only way to give it justice as words fail. For example there is a spot where if you clap you can hear an echo but walk two steps away from that spot and there is no echo. The age of the Fort is comparable to the early Norman kings of England - I had no idea that buildings like this existed in India that far back.There is a lot to see, and a lot to climb - depending on how adventurous you are you could climb to the top mosque.Alas there is a entry fee for Indians and a much higher fee for foreigners......"
Sangram42,,Cleaned but too expensive and mostly you will see deers. For lion and tiger you have to take a bus and that is also not guranteed
Sushant K,5,"Birla Science Centre is really good place, this is my first trip to Hyderabad. And I really like their archeological section."
V V S Ganesh N,5,Durgam Cheruvu Lake in Jublihills of hyderabad is a Nice Place to hangout in weekends especially for couples and lovers.having a pub at the entrace and restaurents inside were of great attraction.
Shailendra,4,"Birla mandir is one of the famous temples of Hyderabad.Made of white marble it looks very beautiful and is one of the most visited places in Hyderabad. You get a beautiful view of the Hussain sagar lake, Buddha statue and Hyderabad city.Worth a visit! "
Xavier D,4,Charminar is symbol of Hyderabad for rest of the country as well as for the world. Unfortunately during my visit it was very highly crowded.
Natarajan K,4,This garden is located close to Hussain Sagar lake. It was a good place to spend time with family and friends who visits the lake for boating for Short time. It's named after the memory of late Mr. NTR sir. Well maintained by the city corporation. For Kids some few play games available in the park and themes too.
Raman G,4,"We visited the fort as part of our holiday to Hyderabad.  It is part of your sightseeing itinerary.  Managed by Archaeology Survey of India. We did not take a guide. ( as compared, for Agra fort you surely need a guide). It is mainly a walk in the grounds and a abt 300 step walk to the highest point in the fort open for tourists. As Senior Citizens,  we did  walk to the top. It is tiring. Did it at a slow pace. The main attraction is the view from the top."
Rajani K,2,"Naturally beautiful places. Large rocks, rocky hills, lake and a beautiful garden draw the park. But poor maintenance makes the place ugly and visit is spoilt. The place is in urgent need of maintenance."
Madhavi,5,Buddha in the middle of the lake makes a stunning view. Take a boat ride in Hussain sagar to see the statue up close.
Sravan,5,I found the ticket prices at the amusement park to be quite reasonable considering the wide range of attractions and entertainment available. The value for money was evident as I spent an entire day enjoying various rides and shows. Specially mission interstellar & Wonder splash and I enjoyed a delicious buffet with wide menu in galaxy restaurant
nkameswararao,4,"Classmates with spouses , numbering 40, visited this place for a day. On the whole it is an enjoying experience. A well organised conducted tour right from reception to departure. It is worth spending a day with dear ones. Lot many things are there to see. Whole concept of this city is appreciable. One interesting spot is film Bahubali Settings.One wonders how  the film is finally made looking at the setting created/seen here. One can surely visit this place with friends /families."
SRIKAKOLAPU,,With lots of greenery this place can be visited in the morning or the evening and its nice and decently maintained
Sunshine42196798460,5,I never visited to wonderla and the experience was great.This place is heaven must visit place.Mainly the food they serve is like homade .

vinodkhedkar,4,"This is the perhaps best zoo in India. Situated in Hyderabad city, this is a must see place. We had a wonderful time especially my kid enjoyed this place. Spread across the acres of land this zoo inhibits various types of bird,reptiles and animals.This is a journey to the jungle.Staff is prompt and cleanliness in maintained. Lion safari is a highlight of this zoo. You need an entire day to see this place and enjoy it thoroughly. Definitely visiting this place again during next visit to Hyderabad."
Alok Kumar,5,Golconda Fort is in the outskirts of city... the tourist guide are must who explains the stories of glory .. they will take yiy back hundreds of years back.. in history... Good for visiting in a cloudy day.. as it's hot in summer.. Specially if sun is scrotchy .. govwirh goggles and umbrella
doug m,5,"Fascinating old fort with extensive fortifications. Allow plenty of time for the long and very hot climb to the top where extensive views are to be had, including the nearby tombs (which are also worth a visit)."
Neha Banerjee,5,We visited recently in Covid times. 1 excellent thing is it's closed for outside but open for people who are staying. So the crowd was minimal.We stayed in the Sitara hotel.We enjoyed hassle-free check-in. Then Ramoji tour and Bahubali tour. Hardly 10-15 ppl which was excellent as per the pandemic situation. Few parks were open and in lush greenery so it was just a close-to-nature trip.My toddler could run around freely and enjoyed it a lot.I will surely visit again.
Ashraf4916,3,"The lake in the city of Hyderabad, beautifully laid out and good tourist spot. Excellent place for outdoor photography."
guddu1954,4,People have been visiting Birla temple but they are just not aware that there is a museum just close to the temple.It has a wide collection of Nizam era and provides a lot of information about Nizam .
vijusjod,3,The lake is not worth to visit. It is clogged with garbage and dirty water all around. Needs proper maintenance and management to become a good tourist spot.
Farhan M,5,Nehru zoological park is very well maintained you will get each and every animal there specially the safari park is really nice 
reshma r,5,"I went there in May 2022 (during the carnival season) with my husband and nephews. Everybody loved that place. The place has so much to offer, including - learning about movie making process, adventure sports, food, music, DJ, dance performances, martial art performances, gifts for participants, beautiful movie sets, green gardens, butterfly garden, and so on. We spent over 12 hours and it was worth it. The ticket cost was approx. 1200 per person, but it's worth every penny. There is bus service inside, you can go from one point to another by bus (no additional cost). Bring your own water bottle as there is a drinking water tap at every point where you can refill your water bottle for free. I am planning to go there again with my parents in November.Only advice - go there when the weather is nice and keep in mind that you will spend at least 6-8 hours outdoors."
muralidhar r,5,Family its come to plan emoji film city it's good plase and good food also new gardens and new children park and goodentertene ment iam very happy the company  provide the ramoji film city enjoy the trip.
Veer2468,4,It is a nice and education place to visit with children. Children will enjoy in this place. I found the entry and parking charges expensive. 
Raman G,4,"It is a full day tour. About 40 km from Hyderabad.  The largest film city complex in the world. The owners of film city also organize tours for guests for the huge complex. Tours from around 9 am to 530 pm. We took a Star experience tour. Booked online in advance from their website. ( they have a toll free number as well for any enquiries) . It is a guided tour of the grounds, sets and the special shows. The advantage is that this tour   is communicating in a AC bus. Which was definitely a comfort for us. It includes a buffet  lunch- which was ok. If you need, the organizers also arrange a bus pick up and drop from various  points in Hyderabad. But depending on your pick up location. It can be a 2 hour ride in the bus to the film city. We hired a taxi for full day. ( abt Rs 3000 for the day). We reached a bit before 10 am. It is recommended to reach by 9 am as they ask to, as the tour definitely ends at 530pm. We did notice that for return to Hyderabad in the evening  there are stalls at film city for return transport , but do not know the charge? ( in case you only take a drop to film city by own transport). You can visit the film city without booking any of the tour package as well. It will be a walk in for the tickets. We noticed that these are quite crowded as a group. If you have visited any such film city  tours abroad, say in Singapore or San Francisco, these are very much of a very high standard and quality in thrills and excitement and experience as compared to Ramoji.But in India, it is surely one a kind. Tour includes, rides, walk through bird parks, gardens, visit film sets,  walk through film sets and shows. The latter include a dance and song show as well.Our tour was very well set up and organised."
Abhishek K,5,"Reaching the temple through narrow lanes may be annoying but once you reach temple, it is really amazing. Plan visit during evening as one can see complete city from Temple (Secunderabad & Hyderabad) . Great architecture of temple & arrangement are good. Tirupati Balaji Deity is worshipped here in this temple.  Nearby is Birla Planetarium & Birla Museum which are good places to visit & one must definitely go there."
rsraghavan6,5,The place is renovated and it's great to have an open air gym and a bicycle track. The flowers and the area is well maintained as of now but it would be nice if there are boards like do not pick the flowers or do not spit and keep the area clean so that people will be a little bit more careful about it.
Umesh R,5,"Long queue was there but it going in proper way, at top of temple lake view is good. Very neat and clean place."
Kaushik G,4,Charminar is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Hyderabad and we had visited the same during our sightseeing in Hyderabad. The place is very crowded with small vendors occupying the entire road outside the beautiful heritage structure. We enjoyed biscuits and tea at the nearby Nimrah Cafe and enjoyed the beauty of the Charminar right in front of us. One can go inside the Charminar up to a certain height and we saw many locals standing inside the Charminar.
anuj1401,,Kids really liked the things on Ground floor and third floor‚Ä¶ planetarium show was also nice‚Ä¶ sit close to the guy who is operating the projector to get the best view‚Ä¶ food items are not allowed inside‚Ä¶
HARISH,4,nice and big garden...you can visit full garden via a small train in ntr garden with a nominal fee..
rosemaryJobin,3,"Good place to take your kids for a visit, They can learn science through experiments. Better suited for kids above 10 year. Kids will also enjoy the Dinosaurium.  It is very crowded during weekends and holidays. I have visited the science center multiple times during the last 10 years - The observation from the recent visit is - the maintanence is bad, many of the interactive instruments do not work, but the ticket price has gone up considerably. It is 80 per head now and if you combine Planetarium and 3D universe, it is 150 per head."
Manohar M,4,Great place especially the planetarium was an eye catching where one cannot resist wondering with time travel.The best place one should visit
sree143in,4,Birla mandir is Lord venkateswara temple built this temple entire with milk stone. very nice look in the evening lights.
Barbara A,4,This is in the middle of the old town with vendors all around. The charminar is impressive to look out and worth a walk to see it.
Ravindra V,4,It's been renovated recently. Best parts are children's park and open gym. The water stinks at places. Still good place to go for morning or evening walk. Ticket price is reasonable. Good thing is no extra charges for parking. During rainy season can get dirty due to mud. Next step should to take care of this issue.
LostMySelfTraveling,5,I love this park. It's a fantastic memorial of Shri Naandamuri Taraka Ramarao Ex. CM OF Andhrapradesh. It's a must vist place in Necklace Road. It's also close to Imax multiplex theatre. Children will enjoy the park alot. Very well developed and beautifully maintained park. 
ramchowdry,,Welcome event would happen for all entered people in the morning. Grand welcome is really good. Thank you
Mutukuloju Pranay,4,the mandir is built by white marble. such a cool devotional place.once after darshan you can see the entire of Hussain Sagar and central Hyderabad monuments outside of main mandir
Trending T,4,this place has got wide variety of animal life and its the best place in hyderabd from almost 30 years.
Lalz,1,"The structure is iconic and is pretty much the face of Hyderabad but, is maintained horribly. I would strongly advise people not to go to the top. The staircase is extremely suffocating and cramped. No railing and once you go in, it's impossible to get out because there're people behind you. You have to get to the top, take a breather, and go down through a similar staircase. We went there and my mom almost fainted. If you're claustrophobic, DO NOT take a chance here. The marketplace isn't that well maintained either. I was born and brought up in this city and was really excited to visit the monument. Ruined everything for me."
sree143in,4,"in This park we can see a lot animals like lion, tiger, elephant, and many more. a lot different birds also here."
PurnimaJaay,2,"The mosque is very beautiful. If you get to go in, then please do. Out of it will be local selling cheap stuffs. Don't get fooled by their pricing. Be alert and bargain well. Stay alert all time. Don't bring kids. Get ur stuff and walk away. Only buy if you want. If not just walk. It's risky but if possible go with any local. "
Kartik M,3,This place was built in 1591 when Mohammad Quil shah shifted his capital from Golconda to Hyderabad. This place have mosque on top floor and is nice. Place is littered with small vendor around makes place busy.
S R V,4,"NTR gardens near Hussain Sagar Lake is a garden where children go round to enjoy their outings on week days. For people like us aged above 60s it was a leisure place where we could see cactus gardens, beautiful lawns etc."
LostMySelfTraveling,5,"It's a great temple made up milk white marbles depicting gods and stories from Ramayan. They don't allow photography and cell phones inside the temple. You need to deposit the cellphones in the safety lockers, and foot wear in stand. Then you can take Darshan with barefoot. You can take Darshan of Lord Ganesha,  Hanuman and Shirdi Sai baba on the way. Then take darshan of balaji ( Lord Venkateswara). On the way you can also see the beautiful city with hussain sagar lake and tank bund. The city looks so beautiful from the temple. There is lift facility also for old and aged people. Overall its a beautiful temple. Saturdays and Sundays the crowd is more."
BRKanth,4,"If anyone want to learn science with real / live experiment, should visit this place. Especially crowded during holidays. "

Global-Bhatakanti,3,"3 Nov 2022: NTR Garden ticket counter. Ticket is INR 20 for adults and free for children below 5 yr. NTR Garden is normally crowded in the evening and almost empty in the morning. Toy train is not working. Min time to spend is 30 min if you don't do any activities. There is paid parking outside. Some things to do are haunted house, typical kids play areas, 3D underwear world. Activity tickets are INR 50 each and combo is 90."
NG,1,Very sad state of garden - totally run down - absolutely avoidable - lovely trees n horticulture but on the whole sad.
Mayank G,4,NTR Garden is good place to Visit if you are in Hyderabad with your family. Good environment and ambiance.
Debasis,4,This is a jewel to Hyderabad. Always beautiful after sunset. We enjoyed our time on the lake side. Must see.
CuriousTraveller2014,3,"White marble temple, overlooking Hussain Sagar Lake, Hyderabad city. Approach roads very narrow. Seems Birla science museum is near by, which opens at 11am, wanted to visit it but went too early to temple.Can visit if you get time."
LostMySelfTraveling,5,"As soon as we went inside we took tickets and also for electric buggies. So that we can go around the zoo park easily. It's a lovely zoo park. There are many visitors come here in holidays from several parts of India. There are wide varieties of wild animals that include while tiger, white peacocks and very big size in macaws ( Similar to parrots but large in size). There is an exclusive fish aquarium too with a separate entrance ticket. You can also rent bicycles for an hour or so. The bicycles must be checked before taking for rent. Overall its a great experience with little kids."

muthukrish2000,4,"This is located near to Birla Mandir.Nice place with more science, art, Dinosarium. You can see big dinosaur Skelton in 3rd Level. Including basement there are 4 levels. You can visit this place when visiting Birla Timing. But only till 5pm."
Amit Bansal,3,"A good experience going around the film city.I booked a package from Ramoji website. The first half was checking around sets via an A/C bus with guide followed by a lunch.The lunch at Superstar hotel was really not as per Ramoji's standard. Poor state of veg food, pathetically slow roti service. Not worth the price. Taste was just OK. If the restaurant can not handle volume, then they should not even entertain that much of volume.The stalls outside offered much better food.The shows were great as well, the package that I opted was too lengthy for my enthusiasm, at around 5 PM, I wish there were no more shows. I wanted a good tea with some snacks, that experience was not that great as well. Food & restaurants surely needs to improve for the prices that are offered for.There was a winter fest that made the place even beautiful with lights, perhaps, I had left with no energy & zeal to enjoy that.It was a good experience, wish I had got some good food."
sahifa,5,wonderful heritage at Hyderabad I have purchased many useful items from this place taxi facility is very excellent over here

The temple is preist freindly and having nice atmosphere. from Temple, you can experience  bird eye view of important places in Hyderabad and Secunderabad especially   scenic  beauty of Lord Budhha statue, Necklace Road, Secreteriat, Assembly, Golconda fort and bridge connecting Hyderabad and Secunderabad.After having darshan, you can visit planeterium, which is very educative and informative. Many Hotels both veg and non-veg serving Telangana authentic cuisine is very satisfactory.for easy travel, Hyderabad Metro is conveniently located. A best  pocket friendly place to visit   and enjoy with family."

balkivinod,5,I have visited muliple times and the location is good fo strolling for some time.  How ever smells emit from the lake due to pollution. It is good place to have evening walk around the lake. But has become congested due to growing city waistline line.
Sightseer33888790670,5,Ah good experience and had ah fun üòä maintenance was good great spot with friends and family it's my 3 Rd time visit 
Jobin a jose,5,"Golconda Fort is located in the western part of Hyderabad city and is about 9 km from the Hussain Sagar Lake. The outer fort occupies an area of three square kilometers, which is 4.8 kilometers in length."
RkRoadie,4,"Birla Science Centre is one time visit place in Hyderabad tour if you are accompained with kids. The way to science centre goes through steep slopes with lot of jaywalkers on it as the same road goes to Birla Temple as well. Parking  charges are Rs. 30 for 4 hours. Combined ticket rate is Rs. 75 / head (includes entrance, Room Royale, Dolls & Archaelogy Gallery, Interactive Science Section, Dwarka, Antartica, NRSA, IEEE, Dinosaurium) and again Rs.75/head (includes Planetarium, 3D Universe). Camera is Free. But need to deposit in locker while entering Room RoyaleDinosaurium is having huge skelton of Dinosaur which kids will definitely enjoy. Planetraium show and 3D Universe is a must watch. Cons :- Feels like ticket is on higher side."
madhavi2022,5,read up before you go - guides are scalpers. Reach early to dodge the heat and crowds! Mask up as poor social distancing
alientraveller,3,"Go here in evening for boating. We chose the speed boat. Do not take the ride outside lake if you are adults, it's like going up an elevator."
amitdon2,4,The zoo is very big and inside they have electric cars which they charge for each person 50rs.its very tiring to walk so better to take an electric car or we can take personal electric car which they charge 2000rs for 120 mins which will be with us through out and capacity is for 10persons.
Divya V,,Highly overrated and outdated. Save your time and money by skipping this. They don't even have shaded walkways after these 20 years. No idea where these positive reviews are coming from.
Paradise39582892651,5,I LOVED IT SOOO MUCH ESPECIALLY THE WAVE POOLS IT IS SOOO FUN AND THE FOOD IS EXQUISITE.WHEN I AND THE SPACE JDM AND SPACE INTERCELLUR WAS AMAZINGGGüòäüòä

Hamid Al-Timami,2,I had high expectations and was disappointed when the boat took us the the Buddah monument and back to the jetty
Shashi Prakash Mishra,5,It's tough to write a review..It's a place where you will get physically tired but mentally you will remain overcharged..
TTDh,3,"When we visited, the place was undergoing some renovation.There are several exhibits around mechanics/energy/space themes. There also is a museum with several collectibles like carpets and crystals and procaeline items.The main attraction hear though is the fossils and the place has a exhibit of a full dinosaur. The exhibits hear give a good idea of what is found in India.If you have a school going kid, worth a visit, will need 3 hours."
NG,1,Very sad state of garden - totally run down - absolutely avoidable - lovely trees n horticulture but on the whole sad.
Mukta2016,4,The NT Ramarao garden in Hyderabad is a nice garden located along one section of the bank of Hussain Sagar Lake and gives a nice view of the lake. The garden has many visitors cumming in the evening for a pleasant time.
W S,4,"It is the epicentre of Hyderabad. Where it all started. It is well worth the visit. I had a tour guide so that I could understand about the building and local points of interest. 
What disappointed me (although I have now seen this frequently on my travels) is that there is one fee for residents and I think is was a 25 times increase of the price for foreigners. As said this now seems the norm. I understand the reason but I had never seen this before in any country that I had been too so was suprised. That being said, it is a major landmark and I would recommend a visit and if possible get a tour guide. It does get busy there. "
skychaserCalgary,5,"Very historical place, walked up to the top and back down again‚Ä¶.superb views of the city from on the top"
nik c,4,"Nehru Zoological Park is a very pleasant place to spend a day.   The park is well laid out with easy access to the exhibits.    The gardens are well maintained and there is a train ride for the kids (even the grown up kids).   There is a safari park ""tour"" and a ""Natural History Museum"" at the park, but I wouldn't bother with either of these as they were both VERY disappointing.   Overall it was a very nice visit and you could easily spend a day there."
Suneela K,3,Takes a 6-8 hours to see completely. Fun filled train ride around the zoo. Lion safari is worth it. Separate bird enclosures. Butterfly park is also good. Nocturnal animals are in a separate enclosure. 2 canteens available for lunch. Most locals get their own food.
Akillchowdary,5,"Ramoji Film City is a wonderful place for full day family outing. It leaves all visiters with some memorable experiences. We were much impressed with the visitor friendly approach taken by the management. The young volunteers available all over the property are always ready to attend to all sorts of queries. The shows were unique and keep you enthralled. Total property is well maintained, clean and adequate provision for food, drinking water and rest rooms. Sprawling gardens are beautiful with variety of flora and fauna. We were lucky to attend the winter carnival which was a grand show of music & dance.Overall, it is a must visit place and should not be missed if one goes to Hyderabad.A must go for based on VIP members because it gives extra benefits for tourists.."
Go12358366988,5,"Enjoyed thoroughly, excellent coordination with best staff. Water games are good specially I loved Interstellar theam."
CuriousTraveller,5,"It is one of the best temples in Hyderabad. I love the temple very much. From the temple you can view the entire city and its beauty. The best time to visit is on Saturday. The crowd is more on Saturdays, Sunday evenings and on festivals. If you like to have peaceful darshan without crowd avoid all the days that I mentioned above. Overall its a great experience."
Deepali G,4,good zoo..well maintained..try to take food on your own..there are lots of varieties...cycling is also available..but try to go early ..
OMKAR PAGADALA,5,A very skill full experience. There are some games which will work on formulas. We can some knowledge by visiting the centre.

Sounak Poddar,4,Birla Mandir has now been established in many of the cities in India and not only that they have set up temples outside India as well. It is a nice place to visit. All the Birla temples are the same structurally so nothing special about the structure here. 
Premnath K,5,I have been around this lake in 2000-2001 when many people didnt know about it. It is definitely well maintained now with it becoming the center of attraction in HiTech City. Go out boating here to enjoy the cool breeze during evenings.
Sardev2014,3,Worth a visit if your in the area and can cope with traffic. A very popular tourist destination. Massive lake with boat trips available to get to the statue in the middle.  You can take both slow and fast boat. 
Udmaam,3,Never go to this place on weekends.. crowd management with regard to battery cars in worst. No one keeps a check at the battery car halts and whoever pushes gets in. Whoever is waiting will wait for ages. Other things are good. Its not easy to get tickets for safari. You have to wait in the queue for at least an hour on weekends. Can have refreshment corners at more number of places. Other things are fine.
Oneil,4,This is one of the places worth visiting when in Hyderabad. It has been maintained & kept fairly clean & enforced by their vigilant security staff. The only short-coming is the rates fixed by the guides there. INR 1250 charged by them is a little excessive.Electronic audio guides need to be installed by the Government/Management at the earliest.

Suresha_Posavalike,4,"It's a beautiful and peaceful place to visit. As Mandir is very beautiful and from the top you can see the Hyderabad. Parking for four-wheelers is limited and the road is a little narrow. Lift for senior citizens is available but usually, need to search for an operator. There is also a free facility for keeping your shoes, gadgets and other belongings in the safe."

Raman G,,"We visited the fort as part of our holiday to Hyderabad.  It is part of your sightseeing itinerary.  Managed by Archaeology Survey of India. We did not take a guide. ( as compared, for Agra fort you surely need a guide). It is mainly a walk in the grounds and a abt 300 step walk to the highest point in the fort open for tourists. As Senior Citizens,  we did  walk to the top. It is tiring. Did it at a slow pace. The main attraction is the view from the top."
SAID A,5,It was sunset time to take some wonderful photos with friends. I recommend to visit it at sunrise or sunset time.
CaptainBasu,3,"The place is a storehouse of some greatly intriguing science objects. However, it is very poorly maintained. The planetarium is small but the explanations were clear. Remember to bring lots of water on a summer day. Though not too big, you will need to walk up and down a number of stairs.Suggest climb right up to the planetarium first (shows in English starts at 1130) walking your way down thru the galleries on different levels to reach the science museum at the ground level. There is a separate ticket for the Planetarium which includes the 3D show, and separate ones for the rest of the place. The entry prices kept changing based on God knows what. It was RS.60 on Monday when we arrived, but came up to RS.80 by Wednesday when we actually visited.The science section needs serious maintenance, many gizmos are either inoperative or totally absent.  The Planetarium offers some interesting shows along with the 3D theatre of the seven wonders of Solar system. Expect to spend three hours at leisure."
Tavisha,4,"Its really nice but when it comes to food please try to give extra plates and spoons, good place to come with family and friends"
parasuraman s,5,"Take jumbo ticket and visit complete science centre (planetarium, art gallery and all four floors of science centre including dinosaurium. You need around 5 hours. You need to schedule based on the language you prefer for the planetarium show.When you visit science centre, don't miss -3 floor where they have many physics activities.Very informative for kids and it will be definitely thought provoking for any child. "

Ratnesh M,5,"My Hyderabad visit would not have been completed if I had not visited this famous temple. After indepence of India, the Birla family - the famous philanthropist and industrialist established Hindu temples at several places in the country mainly of Lord Lakshmi Narayan. This temple being in South India, this temple is dedicated to Lord Venkateshwara. Though every places of worship is sacred, however, the unique thing about this temple is its location. It is situated on a hillock overlooking the necklace road and a part of city - just  mesmerizing particularly during night time. Since camera or mobile phones are not allowed inside the temple, I could not take any pictures inside or of the surroundings. Ample Parking is available there. "

Abhay Mehta,4,This lake is near Jubilee hills and gives good picturesque view while driving from Jubilee hills to Hi Tech city and Gachibowli. The newly constructed cable bridge over it enhances its beauty. One shall dive through it in the night to enjoy the perfect view of cable bridge.
Qkahmed,5,Hussain Sagar lake is named after a famous saint by name Hussain Shah Wali. The lake divides Hyderabad city from Secunderabad city. The Tank bund bridge road takes you to Secunderabad. The lake is a tourist destination for those who wish to take a boat ride and also can view a single rock Budha statue in the middle of the Hussain sagar lake.
sunil vuppala,4,"Must watch attraction in Hyderabad. You can get complete 360 city view of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. You can clearly see Tank bund, Assembly and Budha statue. Lovely peaceful Govinda temple. You can visit other temples such as Ganesha, Lord Hanuman and Sai baba in the same premises. During Dasara, Brahmostavam celebrations will take place. It's a family attraction. Kids also can have good time. You may visit Science museum with kids.  Be careful while self driving your car on the uphill narrow road. You need to have good driving practice to park properly."

There are various sections for different gods.The view from the top is pretty good, especially towards the lake.There is a gift shop right outside the exit which is also a good spot for pictures.I enjoyed checking the shops on the side of the road on the way down back to the city.If you are on this side of the city, it's a good opportunity to also check out Sagar lake."
Jajabor,4,"Must visit for tourists in Hyderabad looking to experience a spectacular view of the necklace road around the Hussain Sagar lake. Parking space is a bit of a problem. The approach to the temple is very narrow, steep and almost always very congested."
advait,4,Zoo is quiet good .inside  zoo hotels are few but zoo is very large very much excited after seeing  white tiger bengal tiger and babbar sher
Nikhil Shah,5,"A very clean and well maintained temple. The top is nice and windy, good view. You have to take out your footwear and I trhink even mobiles, etc before entering. Limited parking available."
mahomed swalleh ameer,4,Situation in the middle of the city of Hyderabad.Its a joy just driving around the circumference of the lake.Lots of entertainment along side the lake.Lots of food.It looks stunning as the sun sets.At night the lights iluminate and makes it very beautiful 
PsychoEdinburgh,4,"This is  very busy monument but worth queuing up to see. Once you've climbed the narrow stone staircase you are rewarded by lovely views of the city, fine stone carvings and multiple arches. Well worth the visit and it probably take about an hour all told"
Lesley,3,"Entry ticket with 60Rs per head. You can find animals like white tiger, tiger, lion, elephants, hippopotamus, rhinoceros and many wild animals. There's a highly priced canteen inside selling chat items and briyani. Have 3-4 water bottles during your visit. By the time we visited, safari ride was not there, which would take you inside the forest with freely roaming animals. Worth to go if you are going as a family with children as they would enjoy the park and the animals. For a gang of friends, you would start feeling devastated by this visit."
Navigator22613068778,5,Nice experience and a best place to enjoy with friends as well as family. The rides are so thrilling and exciting. A wholesome experience. 
dr.pragnesh Vachharajani,4,Nice place of worship. Need to walk a bit from main road. You need to deposit mobile in the clock room. Then need to take stairs to reach the main mandir. Facilities for using lift for senior citizens. Very good views of city from above. Need typically 30 to 45 minutes here
Andrew D,5,"This is one of my favorite places in Hyderabad. The details are quite elaborate and there are many sculptures to appreciate, as well as a lovely view of the Hyderabad city from the top.Mobile phones are not allowed inside, but you can leave it in the cloak room and take a number."

Abhishek807,5,One of the Best Timepass for Kids... Perfect for Them... Should take your kids for this wonderful journey
wjw2018,4,"Once you get past the 'no plastics' security patrol, who will confiscate any plastic bags or make you get your water bottle stamped for a 10 Rs deposit, you're free to enter this zoo (tickets cost 50 Rs)...and WHAT a huge zoo it is! There are not a massive amount of animals but the ones that are there looked to be in a reasonable condition and had food and water, though the cages for the birds didn't have any greenery in them which was sad. For those who don't like walking too much, there are various transport options like a train and some small golf cart trailers who'll take you around  for a small charge. Also, halfway round the zoo there's a bus that you can board, for an extra 50 Rs, to take you on a mini 'safari' where you can see lions, a tiger and some bears. I was saddened to see them in cages though....the area of the safari would be big enough for them to roam free, but they've been contained in featureless enclosures which is sad. Outside of this, there's a lot of imagination shown, with tunnels and fossil parks and all sorts. It does make for a good day out, but there could be some improvement with more seating and some restaurants and water points. Overall, pretty good, though a bit more foliage in the bird cages would be kinder for them, plus more staff presence to stop people whistling and harassing the animals is definitely needed."
jainms,5,Evening times preferred here as the lights gives more beautiful look and can enjoy the visit. Couple of water games & activities here will make kids happy & enjoy their day.
Shankar I,,Frequented by lots of people for leisure. The area is well maintained and people have a good time here.

Rajujacob,5,Its looks very colorful during  night time its very attractive with display of light. Its a such a huge sagar.
The Route Edit,4,"This was my second visit to the fort. Last time we visited we didn't have time for the light and sound show so this time I made it a point to stay back for it. The fort itself is very beautiful provided you like historical places or else it would seem brick and mortar debri. Take a registered guide and remember to bargain for the rate coz without a guide it might seem boring. The view from the top is worth the climb and do check the amazing architectural acoustics of the fort. Coming to the light and sound show, I would suggest you give it a miss. They give you a complimentary odomos tube with the tickets so you can imagine the amount of mosquitoes you are about to face during the show. You will be so busy battling mosquitoes that the real battle stories wouldn't seem that interesting. I sat there and dozed off for a major part of the show. I like history and have watched lots of light and sound shows but I guess this experience wasn't that great for me. "
sandeep g,3,"you find good collection of historic antique items here , good to know how things are used in the old ages .. "
Zain,5,I had agreat and wonderful experience at wonderla. It had veey big rollercoaster which was bery thrilling .
Jinesh S,5,It was a great experience to visit Ramoji Film city. One day would be not enough to visit entire place. However if one has limited time and budget can cover 80 to 90 % if well planned.
Arun A,4,"One of the attractions of Hydrabad, was situated in a conjusted place. It was built a century ago, it withstood all calamities."
chaithu k,5,"NTR marg is so pleasant and peaceful area which is N.T Ramarao's memorial. Beside there is small Urban park near by Hussain Sagar lake which is in Hyderabad. Park is located in the centre of the city, and is close to other tourist attractions Birla mandir, Necklace road, Lumbini Park. It maintained by Budha purnima project authority under Telangana Government."
sanjib c,,"Good historical place to visit but too crowded. The place needs to be be maintained by the authorities for cleanliness as the locals, hawkers, shops and the tourists litter the place with disposals. People over there should be advised and fines to be imposed on breaking the rules. It is a pity that such a beautiful historic place is not maintained. One should not forget to have the falooda and lassi nearby. Shopping for glass bangles is a must for the ladies. "
Peter V,4,"I had a free Sunday in Hyderabad and decided to visit the Zoo. I was pleasantly surprised by the space the animals have: I saw some beautiful albino tigers, elephants, giraffes, tropical birds, etc... What I did not know is that I was going to be the only tourist (ie. white male) in the entire Zoo; so I became the attraction. Families with kids wanted to take pictures with me which was somewhat unexpected. Oh and the other funny thing about my visit is that the most popular animals in the Zoo were the deer! I was barely interested, but the locals were all lining up to see deer."

Farook Uddin,4,"Spreads over 380 acres of land, the zoo is managed by the Forest Department of the Government of Andhra Pradesh, Don't Carry polythene bags, bedsheets, knifes. They are not allowed. Reach early to buy tickets you won't get it online and especially on weekends there is huge crowd and long queues. I would suggest better visit on weekdays if you want peace. :-) "
Dr Manoj Swaminathan,5,"Kids will simply enjoy the various rides, which are indeed cost effective. Better to visit after 5PM."

Ratan,5,It was a very true experience to see the remains of our History rich in culture and construction technique...
Srinivas,,It is not that the Char Minar is an architectural marvel for the general public but the sorrounding and the market place makes it a wonderful experience. You experience an intricate culture while standing near the place. It is thronged by people all around.
Praveen K,5,"Visit to this magnificent fort is incomplete without attending light & sound show in the evening, which tells the story of fort and the city"
FIRDOUS (ARMAAN),5,In my visit as solo I got all the information from staffs they were really good. It's clean I don't like the safari trip animal was always hiding.you need at least 3 to 4 hours to see all. The best part of this zoo is bird paradise where all the birds are free and we are allowed to go inside.
Saurabh A,3,"Goods:The restaurants near to the lake serve good food. It feels really nice to eat near to a lake, especially when the weather is good.BadThe water is very dirty.The places smells at times."

Varsha V,3,"NTR Gardens need a lot of repair and maintenance. After visiting other attractions in Hyderabad, I felt this park is very neglected. The toy train wasn't working, the fountain needed cleaning. Except for the plants nothing seemed lively. But that doesn't stop kids from enjoying. that's the only thing worth visiting there. You will see happy kids all around you. If you have got so much time in your hand, do visit it. Else spend more time in Salar Jung Museum!"
lonetraveler1,4,"This place is like a one stop treasure trove for children. The one star that is missing from the rating is for air conditioning. Otherwise, its a perfect place to spend the day with children. They will spend the day discovering, learning, experimenting and watching. At the end of 3 hours, we were still not done. The Nirmala Birla Dolls Museum , then the Archeology museum, where we really saw the grandeur of our past - stone age, iron age, pottery meticulously preserved, terracotta animal figurines that reminded me of Harappa valley pottery figurines.  Then there was Indian painting, Philately, Numismatics, Art. It was 2 hours before the children exited just the basement floor. Then we went to the science experience center, where children play with specially created learning toys. You can easily put kids there for 90 minutes and forget about them. After that it was time for the observatory in the planetarium next door, so off we went. We could see Mars (nothing impressive) and Jupiter(we saw the stripes of Jupiter and the 4 moons of Jupiter). It was awesome! Then we came back to the Dinosaurium. It has a full skeleton of a large dinosaur, one preserved egg fossil, and some bone fossils. Its an awe inspiring skeleton. The building is basic, but that skeleton.. is something!! We missed the space and Antartica Diorama, but we have seen that earlier. MOre than anything else, this visit got me thinking about private museums in the country. This was absolutely fantastic."
Rohit g,5,pure white marble twmole with what a great finishing.Lobed the view from top of the city.Felt very divine and we enjoyed tge place
Praveen,5,Good place I visited recently. Peace and calm place. Looking so beautiful and enjoyed in the place. Simply nice....
Mitalee2012,4,"Got to see the whole gamut of wild animals enjoying the winter sun. It's best to go early (at 8:30-9am) when the animals are up and about as they tend to retire for the afternoon.Specially enjoyed the nocturnal animal den and snake pits. TPro tip: if you want to enjoy the Safari, take the hop-on/hop-off tickets and get down at the Safari stop (3rd stop after the elephant stop), as it is a LONG walk and difficult to get back to, especially with children. The toy train was also pleasant and enjoyable."
Partha Sarathi M,2,"I went there on April 01, 2017. No where they mentioned that cameras are not allowed. So  the security guard at ticket counter also didn't check out handbag. So we went inside and started doing our photo session work. The maintenance was too poor. When we were almost done with out photo session, suddenly a security guard inside the park (near the lake) scolded and asked to switch off the camera since its not allowed. I told him no where it's mentioned. So we have to stop our photo session and fall back.It's disgusting and humiliating. What hard a DSLR can do in a park?We will never go there again. It's not good for photography loving people. The management is poor."

Raman G,4,"We visited the fort as part of our holiday to Hyderabad.  It is part of your sightseeing itinerary.  Managed by Archaeology Survey of India. We did not take a guide. ( as compared, for Agra fort you surely need a guide). It is mainly a walk in the grounds and a abt 300 step walk to the highest point in the fort open for tourists. As Senior Citizens,  we did  walk to the top. It is tiring. Did it at a slow pace. The main attraction is the view from the top."
Ravindra V,5,Must visit if you are visitor to Hyderabad or a local. Great architecture. There are lot of clothes and pearl shops around.
sunil,,"As the name suggests,it is basically to film makers where u can have replica and sets of any location.One day is not enough to pay the visit to all the places in it and it spans over few hundreds of acres."
Rajendra Kumar,5,"Really spiritually refreshing trip. Visited during 6-8 May 23. stayed in the lap of lush green premises at Kanha Shanti Vanam, the one of kind place. Liked the food and ambiance. Had a visit of Golkonda fort and enjoyed the light & sound show."
Sagar D,2,We went there with so much expections but it wasn't worth of it... Though the entry charge is less u have to pay separately for Battery vehicle  & Safari ride...Jungle Safari is useless..All the animals are in cage only so not sure why they called it Safari..Not mainatned properly when compared to Benglore Zoo..
Suhail Siddqui,5,"A full family place to get up and close with wild and reptiles. White tiger, lions,  leopards, elephants, crocs, snakes, chameleons, owls, giraffe etc.Please do make notice of following point which will help you if you visit over there:1. Entry tickets are just to make entry in zoo.2. If you want to travel on battery car at important point where you can see animals then it ticket you will get inside. (WOULD STRONGLY recommend this as there are lots of waling) or you can opt for bicycle on rent for each individual.3. If you want to take safari which is separate from zoo then, you have buy tickets inside, they will take inside the restricted zone where lions are roaming free (we saw just one).4. If you want to see OWLS, then you have shell 20 INR per head inside zoo. This place is right after reptile section.Overall an amazing place."
YatriForever,4,"The large lake connecting the twin cities of Hyderabad-Secenderabad  attract thousands of locals as well as tourists. The best way to experience lake is to drive around the necklace road and stop by at different designated parking spots; some along the lake side and some across the road, enjoy the view. The giant National flag is something that I didn't see a few years ago! Nice !The speed boat drive on the lake may have some wait, but it's worth it. That's the only way you can get close to the Buddha statue.I wish the authorities do more to keep the lake cleaner, it deserves a better deal.Overall, this is a must see attraction , spend at least an hour.I was there during sunset on a clear sky day, it was beautiful. "
Krishna Sandeep Siram,4,This place is Good but too expensive and mostly you will see deers and some rare species of different animals.For Lion and Tiger you have to take another Safari ride in Bus.

MrH0rnet,5,"This place has 5 sub category to visit1. Planetarium: Amazing experience , specially for students and science enthusiast. Well explanation and 360¬∞ screen are like you are sitting under clear sky. Though , I felt explanation can be made little easier fir understanding of school children.2. 3D movie about solar and space facts:Great for young school children knowing already and having watched many 3 movies it felt boating. 3. Art Galary : perhaps biggest one I hva visited so far. Spread on 3 floors, most people just visit modern art Galary and miss the best part. In front of art Galary there is huge series of art, Specially we liked painting by Iqbal Hussain on Indian Mythology and history . Amazing details. I wish I could take photos but it wasn't allowed.4.Dianasorium: Huge skeleton of Dianasour found near Hyderabad and information are gear. Touching 200 million old fossil is just a great experience.5.Science Museum with live experiments: this is just a unique experience of day to day life physics. Huge learning for any student. There is IEEE experiments to hands on too. This must for any student to visit.Overall, in 200 per head, this is most fun place in Hyderabad so far."

sanjib c,5,Had a wonderful experience. The place was very well maintained and the tour guides are very well informed about the place. staff are very helpful and the food served in the restaurants are good.I would however suggest the management to be a bit more strict on the littering by the visitors in the park. It was a shame to see educated people littering the place with water bottles and disposal bags.

Raman G,4,Went in the afternoon. We walked in 5 minutes to this place from Chowmullah Palace. A visit only because it is popular. And has been advertised a lot. The area around is dirty and crowded with hawkers. The latter keep pestering. The segregated area around it has hawker stalls which is a pain for a tourist. It could have been developed beautifully. One is allowed to climb up to the first floor. We did not do so.
Tushar D,4,My 5 year old son enjoyed. But same time he tired also. I think it‚Äôs ok trip for adult. If someone has interest in movie then that person will enjoy the trip. Area is huge. Food is somewhat costly. Try to visit on weekdays.

preethi d,1,"The zoo opens at 8:30am and the staff comes at 10am that means all the animals will be inside the night shelters and nothing to see,  they should either shift the opening timings to 10am or the staff should come to the zoo an hour earlier than the open timings clean the zoo, animals and open all the enclosures. Worst maintenance."
GANESHNIYER,3,"Right next to In-orbit mall, this is a small lake at the heart of high-tech city. Serene view of lake will cool your mind. But, I would say it not NOT a must visit place.

vasant agshikar,5,"Best time to visit charminar by 9 am if you wanna enjoy the view without hustle bustle. You can click some pics too and observe the ancient monument.

W S,4,"This fort is vast.  It has so much history.  I visited without the tour guide and felt like I did not miss out.  However, whilst walking around, I met a group of people from the USA (although their manager came from the UK but lives in the States now), and they said the tour guide was excellent.  So I cannot really comment on what experience they provide.  They sell books on the history.  Be prepared to walk and have comfortable shoes.   The climb to the top is worth it though as you see for miles.  It is an amazing structure. "
Bhaskar_10,4,"Visited on 29th December 2023The place has two access points - One is from the Boat Club side which I will highly recommend as it is open from 9.30am till 6.30pm. No entry fee is required here. No parkling charges, however parking can be an issue as it is residential area.Boating charges are INR 50/- for normal shared boat ride and INR 400/- for Speedboat which can accomodate 6 persons. Each price is for 15 min lake tour.The 2nd entrance is from the park side whose openning time is 5.00am - 8.30am and 4pm - 8pm - Here one have to pay entrance fee of INR 10/- per adult and INR 5/- per child. Parking space available and is free.Lots of contruction and higtises and raods surround the lake which is eye-sore but there are vegetationa nd natural formations at places which are very good to see. We saw few migratory bird species in the lake during our visit.Also a good initiative is to avoid litters, the place do not have any eateries. Toilets , landscped gardens, paved pathways, gym area, childrens pay area are among many facilities taht his place boasts off.A good place for visit with family of young children as well as senior citizens."
parasuraman s,5,"Take jumbo ticket and visit complete science centre (planetarium, art gallery and all four floors of science centre including dinosaurium. You need around 5 hours.

Nipunika J,3,"When we visited the monument, two tower was under maintenance. The market around it is very crowded. It is better to get down from cab 10-20 metres from the monument and walk. There are lots of jewellery shops around and food vendors. The around place can use a lot of cleaning. "
Raman G,4,"We visited the fort as part of our holiday to Hyderabad.  It is part of your sightseeing itinerary.  Managed by Archaeology Survey of India. We did not take a guide. ( as compared, for Agra fort you surely need a guide). It is mainly a walk in the grounds and a abt 300 step walk to the highest point in the fort open for tourists. As Senior Citizens,  we did  walk to the top. It is tiring. Did it at a slow pace. The main attraction is the view from the top."
Mukta2016,4,The NT Ramarao garden in Hyderabad is a nice garden located along one section of the bank of Hussain Sagar Lake and gives a nice view of the lake. The garden has many visitors cumming in the evening for a pleasant time.

Saurabh M,4,"Exploring Telangana...... Hyderabad.....at birla.maindir.......No cameras are allowed here.......Located near lakadi ka pull metro station.......  Beautiful place......Birla Mandir is near to Lakdi-ka-pul and Assembly Hyderabad metro station. Birla Mandir is well connected by TSRTC buses and MMTS. The nearest MMTS station is Lakdi ka pul. Bus No: 5K,5S,5 From Secunderabad to Mehdipatnam any bus no. 113 from Uppal to Mehdipatnam.Birla Mandir is a Hindu temple, built on a 280 feet (85 m) high hillock called Naubath Pahad on a 13 acres (53,000 m2) plot in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The construction took 10 years and was opened in 1976 by Swami Ranganathananda of Ramakrishna Mission. The temple was constructed by Birla Foundation, which has also constructed several similar temples across India, all of which are known as Birla Mandir....The temple manifests a blend of Dravidian, Rajasthani and Utkala architectures. It is constructed of 2000 tons of pure white marble. The granite idol of presiding deity Lord Venkateswara is about 11 ft (3.4 m) tall and a carved lotus forms an umbrella on the top. There is a brass flagstaff in the temple premises which rises to a height of 42 ft (13 m). The temple does not have traditional bells, as Swami Ranganathananda wished that the temple atmosphere should be conducive for meditation.Apart from the main shrine, the consorts of Lord Venkateswara, Padmavati and Andal are housed in separate shrines. The temple also has separate shrines for various Deva and Devi including Shiva, Shakti, Ganesh, Hanuman, Brahma, Saraswati and Lakshmi. Selected because teachings of men and Gurbani are engraved on temple walls. Birla temples are open to all, as identified by Mahatma Gandhi and other Hindu leaders."
Baburajnair,5,Could find some rare animals here. Well maintained. Bit crowded during holidays. Better to visit during winter. Can spend a day easily here. Safari is also there. Galapagose tortoise is a main attraction. 
Alok Kumar,5,Golconda Fort is in the outskirts of city... the tourist guide are must who explains the stories of glory .. they will take yiy back hundreds of years back.. in history...

795vidhis,3,It seems this place is past it's glory days. The place is in definite need of renovation and probably COVID made the things worse. It used to be a favorite place to take kids but I guess now there are far better options to choose from.
Jalpesh Rojasara,5,"Must visit once in life time. Take standard tickets. No need to take star experience tickets. Well organized visit by film city staff, just follow their instructions u will not miss single  Location or live shows. Plenty of free drinking water stands with chilled and hygiene water. Plenty of food options with price on higher side. They provide guided tour in their vintage style red bus in film city. More than 2000 movie shooting done here. Bahubali set is ok. 3 hotels name tara, sitara and shantiniketan are within film city. Reach at 9 am so u can watch opening ceremony. 2 lines for tickets, 1 for direct ticket from ticket counter and onther who have online tickets. Evening parade is good. In evening whole film city is decorated by lights so u feel u are in another world. Must experience this. Most of rides are complementary free. At sahas adventure location u will enjoy adventure rides free of cost. One full day required for visit. Kids zone is also good and photogenic. Star experience tickets has ac bus, food coupon, welcome chocolate box not worth for its price. Local taxi from hyderabad city available at 1000 to 2000 fair rate. Plenty of free parking lots available at ticket counter. If u have hotel booking u can take u r private car upto hotel. So enjoy ur visit u will definitely remember it. "
Shailendra,1,Once known as the secret lake now the Durgam Cheru lake lies in shambles due to sheer neglect and is becoming a dumping ground.
NIL_MODI,4,Hussain Sagar Lake is very big and easily accessible with public transportation Big Budhha statue is there in the middle of lake. Other nearby attractions are Lumbini Park and NTR garden. Good place to roam around during evening.
aap,3,Firstly I would say instead of animals I could only see grasses and trees everywhere..Half of the cages were empty before I visted hyd zoo I had visited Chennai wonderloo zoo and it was worth to see...could see each and every animal in a proper way..Kids were highly disappointed..we come all the way and don't find any animals in a proper way..Birds was the only thing which was worth to watch ..The famous white tiger was not even seen only 1 and they have made it so huge and grasses all around that we had to lift our children's and peep through it.Govt need to work out for the zoo ..and high maintenance is required...
Mel12939,5,"Massive, huge, mesmerizing, literally takes you one complete day to wander around each and every beautiful aspect of making a film, hospitable people, neatly maintained, good souvenirs, overall would definitely recommend.  "

Mukta2016,4,The Nehru Zoological in Hyderabad is a very well maintained zoo and has a lot of wild animals in very nice and spacious enclosures. There is also a toy train ride inside the zoo which will be enjoyed by the kids.
Amazing_Neo,1,A very rarely visited and populated Sight Seeing Location around Hitec City. The place is not kept clean and is now a broken down resort with selected people visiting. I wont recommend this place as a visit at all. 
Gautam,2,Overall no maintenance of this place. Plastic waste all over fort! No cleaning of toilets since ages despite taking entry fees at admission.
Bianca,,"While the zoo is enormous and has well kept animals and enclosures, you tend to get lost due to no proper maps. It may take you around 4 hours. The aquarium needs to be well maintained. The have a natural history museum, fossil park, safari. The safari is not a must-do thing since the tour is in a closed bus. Do take their battery operated vehicle for 70 rupees per person if you have an elder traveling with you. "
Dilip kumar,4,This place will give you good pleasant nature and also involves in getting the good healthy fresh mind.
casandeep,5,If you are visiting Hyderabad this place you must visit. Though you will have to walk a lot but its worth to do so.  Taking a guide along is must if you really want to understand the rich history and the beautiful architecture. How things were visualized 500 years back is simply unbelievable.
